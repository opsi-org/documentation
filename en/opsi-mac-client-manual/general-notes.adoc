[[opsi-macclient-hints-homebrew]]
=== The opsi product m-homebrew

There are a number of package management programs for MacOS, which allow to provide common Unix programs under MacOS. Typical examples of this package management programs are:

* 'homebrew' (https://brew.sh/)

* 'macport' (https://www.macports.org/)

* 'fink' (https://finkproject.org/)

The opsi product `m-homebrew` installs the `homebrew` system on a MacOS system.

`homebrew` installs the command `brew` on the system, which allows then programs to be downloaded from the Internet. Either a binary is installed directly or the sources are downloaded and the program is compiled on the machine. Therefore `homebrew` also needs the development command line tools to compile programs (`xcode-select --install`).

For security reasons `homebrew` is conceived to *not be executed as root*, but only with user rights. To ensure this in the opsi context a hidden user named `opsisetupadmin` is created during the installation of the `opsi-client-agent` (see also <<opsi-macclient-hints-opsisetupadmin, The MacOS pseudo user opsisetupadmin>>). +
This user owns the whole `homebrew` system on the machine and therefore, only this user should be used to perform the installation of software on the machine via the `brew` command. +
I.e. The `brew` command should be executed as root as follows:

[source,winst]
----
sudo -H -u opsisetupadmin /usr/local/bin/brew
----

For example, the installation of Java in the product `m-javavm` is implemented as follows:

[source,winst]
----
[ShellInAnIcon_brew_install_java]
; https://github.com/SAP/SapMachine/wiki/Installation
EXITCODE=0
sudo -H -u opsisetupadmin /usr/local/bin/brew tap sap/sapmachine
EC=$?; if [ $EC -ne 0 ]; then EXITCODE=$EC; fi
sudo -H -u opsisetupadmin /usr/local/bin/brew install --cask sapmachine-jdk
EC=$?; if [ $EC -ne 0 ]; then EXITCODE=$EC; fi
exit $EXITCODE
----
To find out if the installation of a desired product is supported via `homebrew`, it is best to use the following website: +

[[opsi-macclient-hints-opsisetupadmin]]
=== The MacOS pseudo user opsisetupadmin

When installing the `opsi-client-agent` a 'hidden user' named `opsisetupadmin` is created. This user has no password and cannot be used for login.

The home directory of this user is `/var/lib/opsisetupadmin`.

This user is employed for the following purposes:

* Operating the `homebrew` system (see <<opsi-macclient-hints-homebrew, The opsi product m-homebrew>>).

* The directory `/var/lib/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot` is the mount point on which the opsiclientd mounts the depotshare. +
This is done since access to network shares not mounted in a user directory are very limited.

[[opsi-macclient-hints-opsi-files-dirs]]
=== The opsi directories on MacOS

Essential opsi directories and files on the MacOS client

* /var/log/opsi-script (Log files opsi-script)

* /var/log/opsi-client-agent (other opsi Log files)

* /usr/local/bin/opsi*  (Command line programs)

* /Applications/opsi-script-gui.app

* /Applications/opsi-notifier.app

* /etc/opsi-client-agent (Configuration opsi-client-agent)

* /etc/opsi-script (Configuration opsi-script)

* /usr/local/lib (Help libraries e.g. ssl)

* /usr/local/lib/opsiclientd

* /usr/local/bin/locale (local opsi-script)

* /usr/local/share/opsi-client-agent

* /usr/local/share/opsi-script

* /usr/local/share/notifier.d

* /var/opsisetupadmin (Home directory opsisetupadmin)

* /var/lib/opsi-client-agent

* /Library/LaunchDaemons/ (Start configuration for opsi deamons)

* /Library/LaunchAgents/ (Start configuration for opsi-systray)






[[opsi-macclient-hints-directories]]
=== MacOS directory structure with 'go' and 'nogo'.

MacOS is based on BSD-Unix and has a typical Unix file system structure.
However, due to security reasons, there are several areas that are exclusively reserved for Apple and a few other specifics that are important for the person doing the packaging work:

* `/Applications` +
This is the directory where the graphical applications are located. An application consists of a directory <Application name>.app. Such a directory is not shown in the `Finder` as a directory, but as an 'Application'. Inside this directory the files of the application must be located according to a certain specific pattern.

* `/sbin`, `/bin`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/share`, `/usr/lib` +
These are `apple only` directories into which nobody else is allowed to copy anything. Use instead the `local` variants: +
`/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/local/share`, `/usr/local/lib`
