[[software-on-demand]]
=== opsi Software On Demand (Kiosk-Mode) (free)

[[software-on-demand_introduction]]
==== Introduction

With the module "Software-on-Demand" opsi administrators may give their users access to install a range of software-products.
These software products may be selected and installed user-driven without the administrator needing to do anything.
This documentation shows how the module "Software-on-Demand" works, describes it's functions and how to configure it.

[[software-on-demand_prerequisits]]
==== Prerequisites

There are some preconditions for using the extension.
The product-groups are needed, available with opsi 4.0.
Furthermore the opsi-client-agent and the opsi-configed at version 4.0.1 are needed.

.Required Packages
[options="header"]
|==========================
|opsi-Package|Version
|opsi-client-agent|>=4.0.1-3
|opsi-winst|>=4.10.8.12
|python-opsi|>=4.0.1-7
|opsi-depotserver|>=4.0.1-2
|opsi-configed|>=4.0.1.6-1
|==========================

The Software-on-Demand module is tested and declared as stable for the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 8
* Mozilla Firefox 3.6.15


[[software-on-demand_configuration-parameter]]
==== configuration

The configuration of this extension is based on product-groups and config-variables.
The used config-variables are:

* software-on-demand.active
* software-on-demand.product-group-ids
* software-on-demand.show-details

These config-variables are created with installing the opsi-depotserver-package.

[[software-on-demand_product-group-management]]
===== Managing product-groups

The most comfortable way to create and manage product-groups is using the `opsi-configed`.
There you have to change to the tab `product configuration`.

TIP: Since version 4.0.1.6 of the `opsi-configed` you can change to `product configuration` without choosing a client.

The product-group menu is above the product list.

.product-group menue
image::configed_productgroup_en.png[width=300]

With the drop down menu you can choose a product-group to edit it.
If you have chosen a group, the corresponding products will be highlighted.
 +
With a second icon, filter can be activated or deactivated.
When a filter was activated, only the products of the activated product-group are seen.
 +
Product-groups can be edited after activating the icon with the yellow packets (show editor / hide editor) next to the icon with the filter.
In this view, a new group and it's description can be added. Save the editing by activating the red check icon.
 +
If some more products should be added to a group, select them and press the red check icon. (Press the <ctrl> button and select the products).

[[software-on-demand_configuration]]
===== configure the module Software-On-Demand

The module can be configured, as mentioned above, with the config-variables described in the following table:

.overview of the config-variables of the module Software-on-Demand
[options="header"]
|==========================
|Configuration|Description|Values
|software-on-demand.active|activates or deactivates the modul.|true/false
|software-on-demand.product-group-ids|Product-groups with software-products, that can be used for Software-on-Demand.|List of produkt-groups
|software-on-demand.show-details|Show further information to the user.|true/false
|==========================

There are two ways to use these configuration objects.
For the whole system or for each client.
The following 2 chapters will explain both ways.

[[software-on-demand_systemwide-configuration]]
===== Configuration for the whole system

The configuration here is the default system wide for every client.
The configuration can be edited in the `opsi-configed`. Push the Button `Server Configuration` and change to the tab `Host Parameter`

.part of the module server configuration in the opsi configuration editor
image::configed_serverconfiguration_en.png[width=300]

Another possibility is to change the server-configuration with the following command:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults
----

.edit-config-defaults with opsi-setup
image::editconfigdefaults.png[width=300]

TIP: Administration is also possible with the opsi-python-API or with 'opsi-admin'

[[software-on-demand_client-configuration]]
===== Configuration for a single client

The configuration for a single client - or client specific configuration - is useful if, for example, only some of the clients should have access to the Software-on-Demand extension. Or if you want to make several product groups available to some clients. +

The configuration of the client specific host parameters can be edited in different ways: +

The most comfortable way to edit the configuration is via '{opsi-configed}'.
Choose one or several clients (even all clients of a client group if you want to)
and then navigate to the tab "Host parameters".

.edit hostparameter in the configuration editor
image::opsi-configed-hostparameters.png[width=300]

This editing overrides the system wide defaults.

[[software-on-demand_event-configuration]]
===== opsiclientd event-configuration

There are two ways for the users to start the software-installation:

* with the next system start
* immediately

If the user chooses "with the next system start", the product state will be set to "setup."
If the choice is "immediately", the '{opsiclientd}' creates an event `software on demand`. This event can be configured in the file `opsiclientd.conf` as any other event.


[[opsi-407-releasenotes-clientagent-kiosk]]
==== New opsiclientkiosk application

With opsi 4.0.7 is the prior Web-based solution of the client kiosk is replaced by an application.
Background for this change is:

* Elimination of the problem that means to have a self-signed certificate.
* Greater functionality of the new client.

CAUTION: The old (Web based) Kiosk client no longer works with the new opsi-client-agent/opsiclientd.

[[software-on-demand_install]]
===== Client Kiosk: Installation

If the opsi-client-agent during the installation notes that, the configuration (Host Parameter): _software-on-demand.active_ is set to _true_, it will automatically create a Start menu item during the installation on the Client, on which the Kiosk application can be run directly. It can be found under: _Start -> Programs -> opsi.org -> software-on-demand_.

The installation may be controlled by the following 'opsi-client-agent' product properties:

* `kiosk_startmenue_entry` +
The Start Menu entry for the Client Kiosk (software on demand). +
Default=`software on demand`; editable

* `kiosk_desktop_icon` +
Create a desktop icon for client kiosk ? +
Default=`false`

The used icon for the start menu / Desktop may be modified by storing a `kiosk.ico` file at
`/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/files/opsi/custom/opsiclientkioskskin/`.

Elements:

. Header panel (Customizable to the specification of the Customer)
. Info Button: Version and loaded language
. Data load display
. Button to display the set actions

The main window displays on the left side a list of product groups (7) which are enabled via the Config `software-on-demand.product-group-ids` for this client. In the case that you find more than one group, an additional entry called 'All groups' will be displayed in the first place. This list can be also configured to display groups of products, or other products selections. By default, the first entry is selected, e.G. 'All groups' and in the case there is only one group, then it will be displayed the only available group. +
At the startup or when you changed the selection, the necessary data is read. This may take some time to load, and afterwards the location is displayed at the top of the window (3). +

The config _Software-on-demand.show details_ have in the kiosk application no influence prior to 4.0.7 and can be at this point deleted.


*Logs of the opsi-client-kiosk program:* +

The program logs to `%Appdata%\opsi.org\log`. That is the `opsi.org\log` directory in the Appdata directory of the loggedin user. +
For Example: +
`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\opsi.org\log\`


[[software-on-demand_notice]]
==== Characteristics

The following apply to the software-on-demand module:

* Dependencies are resolved automatically +
   - Software that depends on software from the Demand group, will automatically be set to setup (install), without interaction from the user..

* Software that is already set to setup +
   - In this case, the Checkbox: _install_, will be already activated.
