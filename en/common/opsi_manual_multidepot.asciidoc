=== opsi-server with multiple depots (free)

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-concept]]
==== Concept

Supporting multiple depot shares in opsi aims at the following targets:

* central configuration data storage and configuration management

* providing the software depots on local servers

* automated deployment of software packages from the central server to the local depots

Accordingly, it is implemented:

* All configuration data is stored on the central '{opsi-configserver}'.

* All clients connect to this '{opsi-configserver}' in order to request their configuration data. The configuration data comprise the information on method and target of the '{opsi-depotserver}' connection.

* All installable software is stored on '{opsi-depotserver}s'.

* The '{opsi-depotserver}s' have as well an `opsipxeconfd` running by which they provide boot-images to clients via PXE/tftp.

* `opsi-package-manager` +
A program to (de-)install opsi packages on one ore more '{opsi-depotserver}s'.

* The opsi packages are copied via webdav protocol to the '{opsi-depotserver}s' and are installed from the opsiconfd via a web service call.

* '{opsi-configed}' supports the management of multiple depots.

* Clients connected to different depots can be managed in one bundle if the involved depots are synchronized (have all product packages in identical versions).

The following schema gives a more detailed view on the communication between the components of a opsi multi depot share environment.

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-installation]]
==== Creating an depot server

In order to create an '{opsi-depotserver}' you have to install a standard '{opsi-server}'. This '{opsi-server}' can be configured to act as '{opsi-depotserver}' by calling the script `opsi-setup --register-depot` as user root on the server which should become the '{opsi-depotserver}'. Because this script does not only reconfigure the local server, but also registers this server as '{opsi-depotserver}' with the central '{opsi-configserver}', username and password of a member of the 'opsiadmin' group have to be supplied here.

On Univention Corporate Server the registration of a '{opsi-depotserver}' happens automatically.
The first server with an opsi installation is used as '{opsi-configserver}' and all following in a UCS domain installed systems will register
there as an '{opsi-depotserver}'.

Example: +
'svmdepotde.svm.local' will be reconfigured as {opsi-depotserver} and registered at the {opsi-configserver} 'sepiella.svm.local':
[source,prompt]
----
root@svmdepotde.svm.local:~# opsi-setup --register-depot
----
Now you will be prompted for the {opsi-configserver} you want to connect to . The registration needs to be authorised by
supplying the username and password of a member of the group 'opsiadmin' at the {opsi-configserver}.

.opsi-setup --register-depot : Enter opsiadmin account for the '{opsi-configserver}'
image::opsi-setup-registerdepot-configserver.png["opsi-setup-registerdepot-1",width=400]

Now the {opsi-depotserver} settings are being displayed. In most cases no changes have to be made.
Note that the new {opsi-depotserver} will register as a "Master-Depot", so that you'll be able to assign '{opsi-client}s' to it.

.opsi-setup --register-depot : depot settings
image::opsi-setup-registerdepot-depotsettings.png["opsi-setup-registerdepot-2",width=400]

After the data input is completed the configuration process will start:

Per default it will be necessary to edit the /etc/opsi/opsi-product-updater.conf config - file on the new depot.
If the new depot should only update its packages from the main server, something like this should remain the only active repo-section:

----
[repository_master]
active = true
opsiDepotId = bonifax.uib.local
autoInstall = true
autoUpdate = true
autoSetup = false
; Inherit ProductProperty defaults from master repository
inheritProductProperties = false
----

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-installation-unattended]]
===== Non-interactive registration of a {opsi-depotserver}

Since opsi-depotserver 4.0.7.2 it is possible to register a depot without interaction.

To do this the data for the connection to the {opsi-configserver} has to be passed as JSON object alongside the parameter `--unattended`.

[source,prompt]
----
opsi-setup --register-depot --unattended '{"address": "config.server.address:4447/rpc", "username": "adminuserinopsi", "password": "pwoftheuser"}'
----

The {opsi-depotserver} will be created with defaults.

It is possible to set custom attributes for the {opsi-depotserver}.
For this the JSON object needs to get the key `depot` and as a value another
JSON object with the custom values.

The following example illustrates how to set a custom description:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-setup --register-depot --unattended '{"address": "config.server.address:4447/rpc", "username": "adminuserinopsi", "password": "pwoftheuser", "depot": {"description": "Added with unattended registration."}}'

==== package management with multiple depots
see also: +
<<opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-package-manager>> +
<<opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-productupdater>>

In or to manage opsi-packages with different '{opsi-depotserver}' the `opsi-package-manager` got the option `-d` ( or `--depot`). With this option you can give the target '{opsi-depotserver}' for the installation. Using the keyword 'ALL' the opsi package will be copied to `/var/lib/opsi/repository` on all known '{opsi-depotserver}s' and then installed via a web service call.

If you don't give the option `-d`, the opsi package will be only installed on the local server (without upload to `/var/lib/opsi/repository`).

Example: +
Install the package +softprod_1.0-5.opsi+ on all known '{opsi-depotserver}s':
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -d ALL -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

In order to get information's about what are the differences between depots you may call `opsi-package-manager` with the option `-D` (or `--differences`).

Example: +
Show the differences between all known depots regarding the product +mshotfix+
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -D -d ALL mshotfix
mshotfix
