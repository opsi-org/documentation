The offered tasks for OS independent:

. _Create a Meta Product_ +
A _Meta Product_ is an opsi product, that installs nothing but contains a bundle of dependencies to other products. +
By switching the action request for _Meta Product_ to _setup_ all the dependecies will be handled. So a _Meta Product_ can be used to describe a target state for a complete installation. _Meta Products_ can be nested: A _Meta Product_ may have a dependency to an other _Meta Product_. +
The workflow is similar to the process described in the next chapter but you will not be asked for any installation file to analyze. +
All information is also stored in a file `opsi-project.osd` in the base directory of the product.
This file may be opened and used to modify the product.
