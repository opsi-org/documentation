The offered tasks for OS independent:

. `Create a Meta Product` +
A `Meta Product` is an opsi product, that installs nothing but contains a bundle of dependencies to other products. +
By switching the action request for `Meta Product` to `setup` all the dependecies will be handled. So a `Meta Product` can be used to describe a target state for a complete installation. `Meta Product`s can be nested: A `Meta Product` may have a dependency to an other `Meta Product`. +
The workflow is similar to the process described in the next chapter but you will not be asked for any installation file to analyze. +
All information is also stored in a file `opsi-project.osd` in the base directory of the product.
This file may be opened and used to modify the product.
