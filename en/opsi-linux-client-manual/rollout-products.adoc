== Rollout of existing products to Linux.

For the deployment of software to clients, the _opsi-client-agent_ must be installed on them.
This can be rolled out on <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration,existing-machines>>.


Subsequently, the <<firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests-configed,{opsi-configed}>> management interface is used to deploy software to clients.


The following products are provided by opsi for Linux as standard:

* `opsi-linux-client-agent`
* `swaudit`
* `hwaudit`
* `l-system-update`
* `opsi-configed`
* `opsi-logviewer`
* `opsi-auto-update`
* `opsi-linux-client-kiosk`
* `opsi-setup-detector`
* ``
