[[opsi-manual-multidepot]]
== opsi-server with multiple depots

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-concept]]
=== Concept

Supporting multiple depot shares in opsi aims at the following targets:

* central configuration data storage and configuration management

* providing the software depots on local servers

* automated deployment of software packages from the central server to the local depots

Accordingly, it is implemented:

* All configuration data is stored on the central '{opsi-configserver}'.

* All clients connect to this '{opsi-configserver}' in order to request their configuration data. The configuration data comprise the information on method and target of the '{opsi-depotserver}' connection.

* All installable software is stored on '{opsi-depotserver}s'.

* The '{opsi-depotserver}s' have as well an `opsipxeconfd` running by which they provide boot-images to clients via PXE/tftp.

* `opsi-package-manager` +
A program to (de-)install opsi packages on one ore more '{opsi-depotserver}s'.

* The opsi packages are copied via webdav protocol to the '{opsi-depotserver}s' and are installed from the opsiconfd via a web service call.

* '{opsi-configed}' supports the management of multiple depots.

* Clients connected to different depots can be managed in one bundle if the involved depots are synchronized (have all product packages in identical versions).

The following schema gives a more detailed view on the communication between the components of a opsi multi depot share environment.

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-installation]]
=== Creating a (slave) depot-servers

In order to create a '{opsi-depotserver}' you have to install a standard '{opsi-server}'. This '{opsi-server}' can be configured to act as '{opsi-depotserver}' by calling the script `opsi-setup --register-depot` at that server which should be become the '{opsi-depotserver}'. Because this script does not only reconfigure the local server, but also registers this server as '{opsi-depotserver}' with the central '{opsi-configserver}', username and password of a member of the 'opsiadmin' group have to be supplied here.

Example: +
'svmdepotde.svm.local' will be reconfigured as '{opsi-depotserver}' and registered at the '{opsi-configserver}' 'sepiella.svm.local':
[source,shell]
----
svmdepotde:~# opsi-setup --register-depot
----
Now you will be prompted for the '{opsi-configserver}' you want to connect to in order to make the server you are working on to a '{opsi-depotserver}' at the selected '{opsi-configserver}'. To do this you have to give user name and password of a member of the group 'opsiadmin' at the '{opsi-configserver}'.

.opsi-setup --register-depot : Enter opsiadmin account for the '{opsi-configserver}'
image::opsi-setup-registerdepot-configserver.png["opsi-setup-registerdepot-1",width=400]

Now the '{opsi-depotserver}' settings will be displayed and may be changed.

Normally you do not have to change anything.

.opsi-setup --register-depot : depot settings

After the data input is completed the configuration process will start:

=== package management with multiple depots
see also: +
<<opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-package-manager>> +
<<opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-productupdater>>

In or to manage opsi-packages with different '{opsi-depotserver}' the `opsi-packet-manager` got the option `-d` ( or `--depot`). With this option you can give the target '{opsi-depotserver}' for the installation. Using the keyword 'ALL' the opsi package will be copied to `/var/lib/opsi/repository` on all known '{opsi-depotserver}s' and then installed via a web service call.

If you don't give the option `-d`, the opsi package will be only installed on the local server (without upload to `/var/lib/opsi/repository`).

Example: +
Install the package +softprod_1.0-5.opsi+ on all known '{opsi-depotserver}s':
[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-manager -d ALL -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

In order to get information's about what are the differences between depots you may call `opsi-packet-manager` with the option `-D` (or `--differences`).

Example: +
Show the differences between all known depots regarding the product +mshotfix+
[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-manager -D -d ALL mshotfix
mshotfix
