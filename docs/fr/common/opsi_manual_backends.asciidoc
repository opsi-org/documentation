[[opsi-manual-backends]]
== opsi data storage (backends)

[[opsi-manual-backends-file]]
=== file backend

With the backend type '{file backend}' the configuration information is kept in text files (ini file syntax) on the server.

Important details of the backend 'file' :

* It is the default backend
* You will find the files of this backend at `/var/lib/opsi`.

More details to the files and theire structure you will find at <<opsi-manual-important-files-filebackend>>.

[[opsi-manual-backends-ldap]]
=== ldap-Backend

The opsi backends are configured at `/etc/opsi/backends/*.conf`. If you are intend to use the '{ldap-backend}', you have to write down the detail how to access your LDAP in the `ldap.conf`file here.

Furthermore you have to configure for which data you want to use the ldap backend. How to do this is described in the 'getting started' manual chapter 'backend configuration'.

The opsi data you will find below the LDAP base at the 'organizationalRole cn=opsi' (e.g. cn=opsi, dc=uib, dc=local). Below this node you will find the complete opsi data structure.

You may use for example the tool 'Jxplorer' to browse the LDAP data.

=== mysql backend

[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-inventory]]
==== mysql backend for inventory data

Inventory data at the '{file-backend}' is stored in structured text files by default. This type of storage is not very useful if you wish to form free queries on these data. In order to allow free queries and reports a mysql based backend for the inventory data has been introduced.

The main characteristics of this backend are:
* only for inventory data free (for other data it is part of a co funding project until now)
* optional (not the default backend)
* a very fine granulated data structure with an additional table to make queries easier.
* a history function which tracks changes in the inventory.

Regarding the very different structure of the components in the inventory the resulting data structure is complex.

The table 'hosts' comprises all known hosts. For every device type we use two tables: The 'HARDWARE_DEVICE_' .table describes the model without individual aspects like the serial number. The 'HARDWARE_CONFIG' table stores these individual and configuration data.

These both tables are connected via the field hardware_id. This is the resulting list of tables:

The software inventory uses as primary keys the following entries:

* Name +
This is the  'windowsDisplayName' or, if this entry isn't found at the registry, it is the 'windowsSoftwareId'. Both values come from the registry: +
'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall' +
'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<id> DisplayName'

* Version +
'HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\<id> DisplayVersion'

* SubVersion
* Language
* Architecture (32 Bit / 64 Bit)

At the table 'Software_config' these primary keys are integrated to one key:  'config_id'.

[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-configdata-overview]]
==== mysql backend for configuration data

The '{mysql-backend}' for configuration data is available since opsi 4.0 and is published as co funding project.

The '{mysql-backend}' has a high performance which is important for large installations.



Here a data structure overview:

[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-initializing]]
==== Initializing the MySQL-Backend

First, the mysql-server has to be installed (if not done yet):
[source,shell]
----
apt-get install mysql-server
----
In the next step the administrative password for the mysql-server has to been set:
[source,shell]
----
mysqladmin --user=root password linux123
----

The command
[source,shell]
----
opsi-setup --configure-mysql
----
will now initialize the mysql backend.

A example session:

.Dialog: opsi-setup --configure-mysql
image::mysql-config-input-mask.png["Dialog: opsi-setup --configure-mysql",width=400]

.Output: opsi-setup --configure-mysql
image::mysql-config-output.png["Output: opsi-setup --configure-mysql",width=400]

At all questions (beside the password) you may accept the defaults by pressing 'ENTER'.

As next step you have to configure how (for which methods) opsi should use which backend. Therefore please edit the file '/etc/opsi/backendManager/dispatch.conf' .

A detailed description for this configuration you will find at the 'getting started' manual. The configuration file also contains a lot of examples of typical configurations.

A configuration for the use of the '{mysql-backend}' (without internal dhcpd) looks like that:
[source,opsifiles]
----
backend_.*         : mysql, opsipxeconfd
host_.*            : mysql, opsipxeconfd
productOnClient_.* : mysql, opsipxeconfd
configState_.*     : mysql, opsipxeconfd
.*                 : mysql
----

Finally you have to activate the changed configuration with the following commands:
[source,shell]
----
opsi-setup --init-current-config
opsi-setup --set-rights
/etc/init.d/opsiconfd restart
/etc/init.d/opsipxeconfd restart
----

[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-access-config]]
==== Configure the mysql database for access from outside the server
### has to be written ###

[[opsi-manual-backends-hostcontrol]]
=== HostControl backend

The HostControl backend does not store any information. It is a special backend to control the opsi clients.

Typical tasks are to send Wake-On-Lan signals and send control signals to the '{opsi-client-agent}'.

The HostControl backend is configured by the configuration file `/etc/opsi/backends/hostcontrol.conf`. Configuration options are here:

* +opsiclientdPort+: +
Network port to contact the {opsi-client-agent}.

* +hostRpcTimeout+: +
Timeout (in seconds) connecting a {opsi-client-agent}.

* +resolveHostAddress+: +
This option controls whether the name resolution of a opsi-client address is primary done by the opsi database or by the name resolution of the operating system of the '{opsi-server}'.
If this option is +True+, the '{opsi-server}' tries at first to get the IP-Address of a '{opsi-client}' by the name resolution of the operating system (DNS, /etc/hosts) and if this fails the opsi database is used.
To use the opsi database at first, you have to set this option to +False+.

* +maxConnections+: +
Maximal number of concurrent connections to '{opsi-client-agent}s'.

* +broadcastAddresses+: +
List of broadcast addresses used to send Wake-On-Lan broadcasts.


[[opsi-manual-backends-convert]]
=== Conversion between different backends

The command `opsi-convert` converts the opsi configuration files from one backend to another. The target or the source can be assigned in different ways:


* backend name: +
A backend on the current server can be addressed with just the backend name.  The command `opsi-convert file mysql` converts the data base of the current server from '{file-backend}' to the '{mysql-backend}'.

* Service address +
Providing a full qualified service address allows access to a remote servers data base (after passing the users password). The service address looks like:
https://<username>@<ipadresse>:4447/rpc
You will be asked for the passwords. +
The conversion command looks like that:
[source,shell]
----
opsi-convert -s -l /tmp/log https://uib@192.168.2.162:4447/rpc   https://opsi@192.168.2.42:4447/rpc
----

* Configuration directories +
With a declaration of a configuration directory for the specified backend manager configuration source or target can be described in detail.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-convert --help

Usage: opsi-convert [options] <from> <to>
Convert an opsi database into an other.
Options:
    -h        show this help text
    -V        show version information
    -q        do not show progress
    -v        increase verbosity (can be used multiple times)
    -c        clean destination database before writing
    -s        use destination host as new server
    -l <file> log to this file

<from> and <to> can be:
     - the name of a backend as defined in /etc/opsi/backends (file, ldap, ...)
     - the url of a opsi configuration service
       http(s)://<user>@<host>:<port>/rpc

[[opsi-manual-backends-bootfiles]]
=== Boot files

`/tftpboot/linux` contains the boot files needed for the system start with the PXE boot proms.

[[opsi-manual-backends-securing-shares]]
=== Securing the shares with encrypted passwords

The '{opsi-client-agent}' accesses the shares provided by the '{opsi-server}' to get the software which have to be installed at the client.

The mount of these shares is done by using the user 'pcpatch'. That these shares are not public and have to be mounted using a password is important for:
* general system security and data integrity
* meet the license agreements of special software packets

To give the client task '{opsi-client-agent}' access to authentication data, the server creates a specific key ('{opsi-host-key}') when creating a client. This key is stored (at the '{file-backend}') in the file   `/etc/opsi/pckeys` and is passed to the PC with the (re)installation request. The '{opsi-client-agent}' will store this key in the local file  `c:\program files\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsiclientd\opsiclientd.conf`
during system installation (access rights limited to the administrators). Also, on the server, the file `/etc/pckeys` is only accessible by the user 'root' and members of the group 'opsiadmin'. This way every PC has got an unique key only known to the client itself and the '{opsi-server}', not accessible by client standard users. The key is used to encrypt the password of the user 'pcpatch'. The encrypted password will be transferred to the client at boot time via web service. Hence the servers 'pcpatch' password can be changed any time. The new encrypted password will be sent to every client at the next reboot.
