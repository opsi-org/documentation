[[software-on-demand_introduction]]
== Introduction

With the module "Software-on-Demand" opsi-administrators may give their users access to install a range of software-products.
These software-products may be selected and installed user-driven without the administrator needing to do anything.
This documentation shows how the module "Software-on-Demand" works, describes it's functions and how to configure it.

[[software-on-demand_prerequisits]]
== Prerequisits

First is to be mentioned, that the "Software-on-Demand" module is fee-required at the moment. It is part of a so called http://uib.de/en/opsi_cofunding/[cofunding-project]. +

There are some preconditions for using the extension.
The product-groups are needed, available with opsi 4.0.
Furthermore the opsi-client-agent and the opsi-config at version 4.0.1 are needed.

.Required Packages
[options="header"]
|==========================
|opsi-Package|Version
|opsi-client-agent|>=4.0.1-3
|opsi-winst|>=4.10.8.12
|python-opsi|>=4.0.1-7
|opsi-depotserver|>=4.0.1-2
|opsi-configed|>=4.0.1.6-1
|==========================

The Software-on-Demand module is tested and declared as stable for the following browsers:

* Internet Explorer 8
* Mozilla Firefox 3.6.15


[[software-on-demand_configuration-parameter]]
== configuration

The configuration of this extension is based on product-groups and config-variables.
The used config-variables are:

* software-on-demand.active
* software-on-demand.product-group-ids
* software-on-demand.show-details

These config-variables are created with installing the opsi-depotserver-package.

CAUTION: Pleaes notice the minimum requirements of the opsi-depotserver-package. +
(see also chapter: Prerequisits)
If the config-variables are not availabel, they can be added via `opsi-setup`:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --init-current-config
----

[[software-on-demand_product-group-management]]
=== Managing product-groups

The most comfortable way to create and manage product-groups is using the `opsi-configed`.
There you have to change to the tab `product configuration`.

TIP: Since version 4.0.1.6 of the `opsi-configed` you can change to `product configuration` without choosing a client.

The product-group menue is above the productlist.

.product-group menue
image::configed_productgroup_en.png[width=300]

With the dropdown-menu you can choose a product-group to edit it.
If you have choosen a group, the corresponding products will be highlighted.
 +
With a second icon, filter can be activated or deactivated.
When a filter was activated, only the products of the activated product-group are seen.
 +
Product-groups can be edited after activating the icon with the yellow packets (show editor / hide editor) next to the icon with the filter.
In this view, a new group and it's description can be added. Save the editing by activating the red check icon.
 +
If some more products should be added to a group, select them and press the red check icon. (Press the <ctrl> button and select the products).

[[software-on-demand_configuration]]
=== configure the module Software-On-Demand

The module can be configured, as mentioned above, with the config-variables described in the following table:

.overview of the config-variables of the module Software-on-Demand
[options="header"]
|==========================
|Configuration|Description|Values
|software-on-demand.active|activates or deactivates the modul.|true/false
|software-on-demand.product-group-ids|Product-groups with software-products, that can be used for Software-on-Demand.|List of produkt-groups
|software-on-demand.show-details|Show further information to the user.|true/false
|==========================

There are two ways to use these configuration objects.
For the whole system or for each client.
The following 2 captures will explain both ways.

[[software-on-demand_systemwide-configuration]]
==== Configuration for the whole system

The configuration here is the default systemwide for each client.
The configuration can be edited in the `opsi-configed`. Push the Button `Server Configuration` and change to the tab `Host Parameter`

.part of the module server configuration in the opsi configuration editor
image::configed_serverconfiguration_en.png[width=300]

Another posibility ist to change the server-configuration with the following command:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults
----

.edit-config-defaults with opsi-setup
image::editconfigdefaults.png[width=300]

TIP: Administration is also possible with the opsi-python-API or with 'opsi-admin'

[[software-on-demand_client-configuration]]
==== Configuration for a single client

The configuration for a single client - or client specific configuration - is useful if, for example, only some of the clients should have access to the Software-on-Demand extension. Or if you want to make several product groups available to some clients. +

The configuration of the client specific host parameters can be edited in different ways: +

The most comfortable way to edit the configuration is via '{opsi-configed}'.
Choose one or several clients (even all clients of a clientgroup if you want to)
and then navigate to the tab "Host parameters".

.edit hostparameter in the configuration editor
image::opsi-configed-hostparameters.png[width=300]

This editing overrides the systemwide defaults.

[[software-on-demand_event-configuration]]
=== opsiclientd event-configuration

There are two ways for the users to start the software-installation:

* with the next system start
* immediately

If the user chooses "with the next system start", the product state will be set to "setup."
If the choice is "immediately", the '{opsiclientd}' creates an event `software on demand`. This event can be configured in the file `opsiclientd.conf` as any other event.

[[software-on-demand_CI]]
=== Customize to corporate identity

The look of the `software-on-demand` module can be customized to the companies corporate identity. Therefore the file `opsiclientd.css` has to be customized. It lies under: +
`C:\Programme\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsiclientd\static_html` +

It can be edited and then reloaded. The changes have to be copied to the server to remain with new '{opsi-client-agent}' installations.
Copy the CSS-file and perhaps a file with the companie's logo to the server directory: +
`/opt/pcbin/install/opsi-client-agent/files/opsi/dist/opsiclientd/static_html`

To avoid errors, we recommend to set rights after changing the configuration.

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-setup --set-rights /opt/pcbin/install/opsi-client-agent
----

CAUTION: The customization will not automatically be saved at the moment. If you install {opsi-client-agent} again you will loose the changes. Don't forget to save the files, before upgrading the system.


[[software-on-demand_usage]]
== Usage

The `software-on-demand` module contains a web application, based on the '{opsiclientd}'. This can be reached by every client via browser URL `https://localhost:4441/swondemand`.

If the host-parameter `software-on-demand.active`  is "true" an entry in the start-menue will be added during the installation of the '{opsi-client-agent}'.
A shortcut in the start-menu will be created in
`Start -> Program Files -> opsi.org -> software-on-demand`, that calls the URL above.

It can be configured, with `software-on-demand.show-details` wether more or less details are shown.

With authentification a connect via network ist possible.

.overview of the `software-on-demand` list
image::opsi-software-on-demand_en.png[width = 300]

The user can choose some software from the list by activating the checkbox.
If the software has been already installed, the choice is to install or to deinstall the software first. Other software, that has opsi-driven dependencies to the choosen program will not be deinstalled.
Choose "continue" to go to the next page.

If the parameter `software-on-demand.show-details` is set to "true" the software-packages with opsi-driven dependencies will be shown at this place, too.

.overview of succeeding actions
image::opsi-software-on-demand_actions_en.png[width=300]

There are three possibilities to continue at this time. If you choose the button "back", the choice can be changed. With "process on next boot" the changes are sent to the opsi-service and appear with the next system boot.
With "process now" the installaion will proceed immedialtely.


== Specialities

There are some specialities for the software-on-demand module:

* software-dependencies will be set automatically +
  - If there are some software-dependencies to other software (e.g. javaVM) outside the on-demand-group, it will be set to setup automatically +
* Any software that has the status "setup" will be displayed in the overview-page.
