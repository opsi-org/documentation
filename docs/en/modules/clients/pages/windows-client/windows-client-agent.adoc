[[opsi-manual-win-client-agent]]
= Client Agent (Windows)

With opsi, you can automatically distribute software to clients by initiating installations or updates directly from the server, requiring no user interaction. These installations run in the background, seamlessly without the users' awareness. This approach also prevents instances where less confident users might inadvertently cancel an installation.

To facilitate these automatic processes, opsi employs a specialized agent on the client computers: the client agent. This agent ensures that installations and updates proceed efficiently and without any need for user intervention.

[[opsi-manual-client-agent-directories]]
== Important Directories

// cspell: ignore program, loginblocker
//%programfiles%\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsiclientd\opsiclientd.conf

The installation directory for the Windows client agent is `c:\program files (x86)\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent`. This directory contains all components of the client agent, including the `opsiclientd`, `notifier`, and `opsi-script` folders. Additionally, these subdirectories contain the configuration files, various libraries, and graphical templates for the aforementioned programs.

NOTE: The directory `c:\program files (x86)\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent` is protected against modifications by general users; only administrators possess write access to this location. The file `c:\program files (x86)\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsiclientd\opsiclientd.conf` is also restricted to be read-only by administrators.

Moreover, Windows hosts another directory at `c:\opsi.org`, which stores some variable data. For example, this includes logfiles (in the `log` directory), the package cache for the xref:opsi-modules:wan-support.adoc[WAN/VPN Extension] (in the `cache` directory), certificates, and much more.

The logfile for `opsiclientd` can be found at `c:\opsi.org\log\opsiclientd.log`, and the logfile for the <<opsi-manual-client-agent-opsi-login-blocker>> is located at `c:\opsi.org\log\opsi_loginblocker.log`.

[[opsi-manual-client-agent-opsi-login-blocker]]
== opsi Login Blocker

// cspell: ignore loginblockerstart
On Windows, the opsi login blocker (detailed in xref:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc#blocklogin-notifier[]) plays a crucial role. It prevents users from logging in while an installation is in progress. The login screen becomes available only after the installation is complete.

TIP: The opsi login blocker is enabled by default (`on`). This setting corresponds to the `loginblockerstart` property of the localboot product `opsi-client-agent`.

.The opsi Login Blocker is active by default.

The opsi login blocker operates as a credential provider filter, which is implemented in the file `c:\windows\system32\OpsiLoginBlocker.dll`. This component effectively blocks all credential providers until either an event is completed or a specified timeout is reached, with the default timeout set to 120 seconds.

// cspell: ignore msiexec, interactive
[[opsi-manual-client-agent-msi]]
== Client Agent (MSI Package)

The Windows client agent is also available as an MSI package (Microsoft Installer). You can find it in our public repository at https://tools.43.opsi.org/stable/opsi-client-agent.msi. This MSI package offers the same parameters as the `oca-installation-helper[.exe]` program, which is detailed in the section xref:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc#opsi-manual-clientagent-subsequent-installation-oca-installation-helper[]. These parameters can be specified using the `INSTALL_PARAMS` property when installing the MSI package:

[source,console]
----
msiexec /i opsi-client-agent.msi INSTALL_PARAMS="--non-interactive --service-address=https://opsiserver.domain.tld:4447 --service-username=msi --service-password=secret"
----

TIP: When distributing the MSI package via group policy, it's recommended to define the `INSTALL_PARAMS` in an MST (Microsoft Transform) file. You can create this MST file using a database table editor like link:https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/win32/msi/orca-exe[[Orca.exe]], which is a part of the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

[[opsi-manual-client-agent-bitlocker-suspend]]
== Deactivate BitLocker Protection

For Windows 10 clients that have BitLocker encryption enabled (requiring manual password entry on boot), unattended installation of software and patches is not feasible. To facilitate reboots triggered by `opsiclientd` events without necessitating password entry, you can enable the `suspend_bitlocker_on_reboot` feature.

WARNING: It's important to note that deactivating BitLocker protection inherently leads to a decrease in security, as the password is temporarily stored in plain text on the hard disk.

To activate this feature on selected clients, you should first establish a standard configuration:

// cspell: ignore clientconfig Suspending
[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute config_createBool clientconfig.suspend_bitlocker_on_reboot "Suspending Bitlocker at Reboot" false
----

The default value `false` aligns with the setting in the provided `opsiclientd.conf` file (for more information, refer to section <<opsi-manual-clientagent-configuration>>). To set the host parameter for the client `client.domain.de`, execute the following command on the opsi config server:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute configState_create clientconfig.suspend_bitlocker_on_reboot client.domain.de true
----

NOTE: You can also activate this option on clients that do not use BitLocker encryption. Doing so should not impact the operation of `opsiclientd` in any way.
