= Adding Clients (Windows)

This chapter explains how to integrate Windows clients into the opsi environment. We'll begin by adding existing clients and then proceed to demonstrate how to incorporate new clients.

TIP: Remember, opsi is capable of managing Linux and macOS clients as well. For more information on this, please refer to the chapters xref:clients:linux-client/linux-client-manual.adoc[Linux Clients] and xref:clients:macos-client/mac-client-manual.adoc[macOS Clients].
