= Adding Clients (macOS)

This chapter outlines the process of integrating macOS clients into the opsi environment. We'll first guide you through adding existing clients, followed by instructions on how to add new clients.

TIP: opsi also supports the management of Linux and Windows clients. For detailed information on these, refer to the chapters xref:clients:linux-client/linux-client-manual.adoc[Linux Clients] and xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-manual.adoc[Windows Clients].

== Integrating existing Clients

To add existing macOS clients with an already installed operating system to opsi, install the client agent on the respective computer. Once installed, the client will appear in the client list of the management interface, even if you have not previously added it there.

There are two primary methods for installing the client agent:

* <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-oca-installer>>: This approach involves installing the client agent directly on the client. It’s especially effective for setting up individual computers.
* <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy>>: This method focuses on installing the client agent via the server. It’s optimal for mass rollouts, assuming the required activations are in place on the macOS clients.

It may be necessary to grant the `opsiclientd` full disk access (see section xref:clients:macos-client/general-notes.adoc#opsi-macclient-hints-fulldiskaccess[Granting Full Disk Access]).

NOTE: If you already have another software distribution method in place, you can use it to deploy the `opsi-mac-client-agent`.

=== Using *opsi-deploy-client-agent*

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` tool enables the distribution of the opsi client agent directly from the opsi server to the clients, offering an efficient approach for integrating numerous clients into the opsi environment from the server itself.

Requirements for macOS clients:

* An administrative account
* Activated SSH access

NOTE: SSH access is disabled by default in current versions of macOS. You can enable it via the System Preferences under _Sharing_ or System Preferences / _General_ / _Sharing_, in the _Advanced_ section. Enable the _Remote Login_ option.

Alternatively, enter the following command in a terminal window:

// cspell: ignore Library, getremotelogin, unload

[source,console]
----
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
----

You can check the current status with this command:

[source,console]
----
$ sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
Password:
Remote Login: On
----

To deactivate SSH access on the command line, enter this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
----

// cspell: ignore depot, help

You can find the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` on the opsi server in the directory `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-mac-client-agent`. The program requires `root` privileges; alternatively, it is sufficient if the user is a member of the `opsifileadmins` group. The tool performs the following steps:

. Generate clients on the server
. Copy installation files and configuration (e.g., the host key)
. Start the installation via the `oca-installation-helper` (non-interactive)

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` tool accepts IP addresses, hostnames, and FQDNs. It tries to automatically detect what type of address the user has passed.

Switch to the main directory of the program:

[source,console]
----
cd /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-mac-client-agent
----

Use the `--help` parameter to print the online help:

.*opsi-deploy-client-agent*: Online Help
image::opsi-deploy-agent.png["*opsi-deploy-client-agent*: Online Help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

Typical commands are:

* For a single client:

[source,console]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=root mac-client
----

* For a list of clients:

// cspell: ignore skip, help, existing, HOSTFILE

[source,console]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=root --hosts-from-file HOSTFILE.TXT  --skip-existing-clients
----

The file `HOSTFILE.TXT` contains a list of clients, one name (FQDN) per line. If the clients are not yet known to the opsi server, `opsi-deploy-client-agent` attempts to install the `opsi-mac-client-agent` on these machines.
