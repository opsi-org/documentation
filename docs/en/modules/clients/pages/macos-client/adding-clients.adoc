= Integration of existing macOS clients into opsi.

To include existing macOS clients in opsi, the opsi-client-agent must be installed on them.
This can be performed in several ways.
After you have installed the opsi-client-agent, as described below, the client will also appear in the client list of the opsi-configed, in the case you had not already added it there previously.


Basically, is possible to <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup,run on the client>> or <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,from the server>> to trigger the installation of the agent.

Running the installation directly on the client is appropriate for individual machines.
For a mass deployment of the agent, the <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,opsi-deploy-client-agent>> is generally more suitable.
If the necessary unlocks are available on the macOS clients.

If there is already another way to deploy software, it's also possible to deploy the opsi-client-agent and run the `silent_setup.sh` script included in the package.

Once the agent is installed, existing opsi products can be xref:clients:macos-client/rollout-products.adoc#opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests[installed] on these clients.

It may be required to grant full disk access to `opsiclientd`, see xref:clients:macos-client/general-notes.adoc#opsi-macclient-hints-fulldiskaccess[Granting Full Disk Access] for details.

The method described over here is only for backward compatibility to
opsi 4.1 and the corresponding opsi-client-agent versions 4.1. Please use as possible

=== Using service_setup.sh on macOS (initial installation).

Due to macOS security restrictions, the ability to run scripts from mounted shares is limited. Trying to do the following with a share mounted via `Finder` to `/Volumes` (or similar) will therefore fail (depending on the macOS version).

* Log in to the client.
* Start the terminal program
* For the following commands you need to replace the following placeholders:
** `<username>` with your login name.
** `<mnt>` with a directory name that does not exist yet e.g. 'mnt'.
** `<serviceuser>` with a username that is known on the opsi-server.
** `<servicepass>` with the password of the <serviceuser>. You can also omit `:<servicepass>` together with the mount option `-N`, then you will be prompt to input the password
** `<opsi-server>` the name or IP number of the opsi-server.

[source,shell]
----
sudo su
cd /Users/<username>
mkdir <mnt>
mount_smbfs //<serviceuser>@<opsi-server>/opsi_depot /Users/<username>/<mnt>
cd /Users/<username>/<mnt>/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /Users/<username>/<mnt>
----

without password query

[source,shell]
----
sudo su
cd /Users/<username>
mkdir <mnt>
mount_smbfs -N //<serviceuser>:<servicepass>@<opsi-server>/opsi_depot /Users/<username>/<mnt>
cd /Users/<username>/<mnt>/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /Users/<username>/<mnt>
----

Example:

[source,shell]
----
sudo su
cd /Users/uib
mkdir mnt
mount_smbfs  //adminuser@sepia/opsi_depot /Users/uib/mnt
cd /Users/uib/mnt/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /Users/uib/mnt
----

. Start from the mounted share the script `opsi-mac-client-agent\service_setup.sh` +
Confirm with 2 x Enter
. The script copies the necessary files into a temporary local directory and then starts opsi-script for the actual installation.
. The script contacts the server via opsi webservice to create the client on the server side and to find out the pckey. This is done first with the user/password combination entered in `config.ini`. If this fails, a login window appears with service URL (opsi-Configserver), username and password. Here a user is needed which is a member of the group 'opsiadmin'. It is possible to also operate with a user which is only allowed to execute the method `host_createOpsiClient`.

CAUTION: The client reboots after the installation.

[[firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup2]]
=== Using service_setup.sh on macOS (repair installation).

* Log in to the client.
* Start the terminal program
* For the following commands you need to replace the following placeholders:
** `<serviceuser>` with a username known on the opsi-server.
** `<servicepass>` with the password of the <serviceuser>. You can also omit `:<servicepass>`, then you will be asked for the password
** `<opsi-server>` with the name or IP number of the opsi server.
* During the first installation opsi created a hidden pseudo user named opsisetupadmin, in whose `home directory` `/var/opsisetupadmin` is also the mount directory.

[source,shell]
----
sudo su
mount_smbfs -N //<serviceuser>:<servicepass>@<opsi-server>/opsi_depot /var/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot
cd /var/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /var/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot
----

Example:

[source,shell]
----
sudo su
mount_smbfs -N //adminuser:linux123@sepia/opsi_depot /var/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot
cd /var/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /var/opsisetupadmin/opsi_depot

It is also possible to utilize a user which is only allowed to execute the method `host_createOpsiClient`.

CAUTION: The client needs a reboot after the installation to become active. +
The reboot is *not* triggered automatically.

[[firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy]]
== Using opsi-deploy-client-agent for macOS.

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script deploys the opsi-client-agent directly from the opsi-Server to the clients.
It's easy to integrate a large number of clients from the server into an opsi environment.
As a prerequisite for the clients is needed:

* an activated ssh access

Unfortunately on macOS the ssh accesses are deactivated by default.
To use the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` command these accesses must be first activated.

This can be performed interactively in the 'System preferences / sharing':

image::macos_sharing_ssh_login.png["Activating ssh access",width=300]

On the command line, this can be done as follows:

[source,shell]
----
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
----

A checkup of the current status of the ssh access is possible with the command:

[source,shell]
----
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
----

Disabling ssh access on the command line looks like this:

[source,shell]
----
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
----

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script can be found at `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent` +
Run the script with 'root' privileges or as a user being part of the "opsifileadmins" group.
If the script is not executable, you can fix this problem with the following command: +
`opsi-set-rights /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/opsi-deploy-client-agent`

The script creates the client on the server side, copies the installation files and configuration information, such as the pckey, to the client and starts the installation there. +
The installation runs in the background without any interaction from user and transparently.

The command `opsi-deploy-client-agent` has several call parameters. +
All following examples assume that you have switched to the root directory of the opsi-client-agent product: +

[source,shell]
----
cd /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-mac-client-agent
----

Typical calls are:

* For a single client:

[source,shell]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=uib uib-mmini1
----

Results in the following output:

[source,ini]

* For a list of clients:

[source,shell]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=uib --hosts-from-file HOSTFILE.TXT  --skip-existing-clients
----

Here HOSTFILE.TXT is a file with one client name (FQDN) per line. As long as the clients are not known to the opsi-server, it tries to install the `opsi-mac-client-agent` on this machine

* Display all command line parameters:
