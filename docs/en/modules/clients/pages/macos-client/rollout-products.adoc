= Rolling out Existing Products

To deploy software to clients, the xref:clients:macos-client/mac-client-agent.adoc[Client Agent] must be installed on each client.

This chapter describes the procedure for distributing software to clients via the xref:clients:macos-client/opsiconfiged.adoc[Management Interface *opsi-configed*]. The standard products available for macOS clients include the following:

// cspell: ignore swaudit, hwaudit, javavm, windomain

* `opsi-mac-client-agent`
* `swaudit`
* `hwaudit`
* `m-homebrew` (siehe auch xref:clients:macos-client/general-notes.adoc#opsi-macclient-hints-homebrew[The opsi Product *m-homebrew*])
* `m-system-update`
* `opsi-configed`
* `opsi-auto-update`
* `m-javavm`
* `opsi-setup-detector`
* `windomain`

[[opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests-homebrew]]
== Standard Product: *m-homebrew*

This product installs the package management system link:https://brew.sh/de/[Homebrew], which is also used by various other opsi products, for example, for installing Java (see the chapter xref:clients:macos-client/general-notes.adoc#opsi-macclient-hints-homebrew[The opsi Product *m-homebrew*]).

To deploy the product on a macOS client, select the client in `opsi-configed` under _Client Configuration_, then navigate to the _Clients_ tab. Switch to the _Localboot products_ tab and click in the _Requested action_ column for the product _m-homebrew_. Select _setup_ from the dropdown menu.

NOTE: Homebrew requires the command line tools for developers. Therefore, the `m-homebrew` package depends on the opsi package `m-xcode-tools`, which is installed automatically.

Finally, save the changes in the backend by clicking on the red tick in the top left corner. The icon will then reappear in green. Finally, restart the client or start the installation immediately via the _Client_ menu / _Trigger Event_ / _on_demand_.

On the macOS client, the client agent now starts. It installs the two products `m-xcode-tools` and `m-homebrew`.

.Install the two products *m-xcode-tools* and *m-homebrew*.

== Standard Product: *m-javavm*
