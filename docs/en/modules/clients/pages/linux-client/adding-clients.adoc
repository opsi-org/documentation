= Adding Clients (Linux)

This chapter outlines the process of integrating Linux clients into the opsi environment. We'll first guide you through adding existing clients, followed by instructions on how to add new clients.

TIP: opsi also supports the management of Windows and macOS clients. For detailed information on these, refer to the chapters xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-manual.adoc[Windows Clients] and xref:clients:macos-client/mac-client-manual.adoc[macOS Clients].

== Integrating existing Clients

To add existing clients with an already installed operating system to opsi, you need to install the client agent on the respective computer. Once installed, the client will automatically appear in the client list of the management interface, even if you haven't manually added it there.

There are two primary methods for installing the client agent:

* <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-oca-installer>>: This approach involves installing the client agent directly on the client. It's especially effective for setting up individual computers.

* <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy>>: This method focuses on installing the client agent via the server. It's optimal for mass rollouts, assuming the required activations are in place on the Linux clients.

NOTE: After installing the client agent, you can then install opsi products on the client (refer to chapter xref:clients:linux-client/rollout-products.adoc[Deploying Products (Client)]).

=== Using *opsi-deploy-client-agent*

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` tool enables the distribution of the opsi Linux client agent directly from the opsi server to the clients, offering an efficient approach for integrating numerous clients into the opsi environment from the server itself.

Requirements for Linux clients:

* Activated SSH access
* An administrative account

You can locate the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` in the `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-linux-client-agent` directory on the opsi server. Executing this program requires `root` privileges. Alternatively, it is sufficient for the user to be a member of the `opsifileadmins` group. If you encounter any issues in executing the script, resolve them using the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-set-rights /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-linux-client-agent/opsi-deploy-client-agent
----

The tool performs the following steps:

. Creates clients on the server.
. Copies installation files and configurations, such as the host key.
. Initiates installation through the `oca-installation-helper` in a non-interactive manner.

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` tool accepts IP addresses, host names, and FQDNs. It automatically attempts to identify the type of address provided by the user.

To begin, navigate to the program's main directory:

[source,console]
----
cd /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-linux-client-agent
----

Use the `--help` parameter to display the online help:

.*opsi-deploy-client-agent* Online Help
image::opsi-deploy-agent.png["*opsi-deploy-client-agent* Online Help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

// cspell: ignore linux
Typical commands are:

* For a single client:

[source,console]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=root linux-client
----

* For a list of clients:

// cspell: ignore skip, help, existing, HOSTFILE

[source,console]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=root --hosts-from-file HOSTFILE.TXT  --skip-existing-clients
----

The file `HOSTFILE.TXT` holds a list of clients, with each client's name (FQDN) entered on a separate line. If these clients are not already registered with the opsi-server, the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` will attempt to install the `opsi-linux-client-agent` on these machines.
