[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui]]
= opsi WebGUI

The opsi WebGUI is a modern, graphical user interface for managing opsi within a web browser. It offers quick access to all opsi components without the need for installing a standalone application. Through the web-based interface, you can configure the opsi server, set up new opsi clients, distribute products, and view log files from various devices.

== Technology Stack

The opsi WebGUI is an `opsiconfd` addon (see chapter xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc[*opsiconfd* Service]). After installation, the extension is located on the opsi config server in the directory `/var/lib/opsiconfd/addons/webgui`. The WebGUI uses the following technologies:

* link:https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/id/[FastAPI]: The backend is built with this Python framework. It is used for reading and writing data from the MySQL database.
* link:https://nuxt.com/[Nuxt]: The frontend is based on the link:https://vuejs.org/[Vue.js] framework. It makes requests to the backend, retrieves data, and displays it in suitable formats.

To enhance performance, the backend interacts directly with the database. Until opsi 4.2, the MySQL extension is a paid extension; from opsi 4.3 onward, it is the standard backend (see chapter xref:server:components/mysql.adoc[MySQL Server]). Additionally, the WebGUI communicates with `opsiconfd` for session handling and logging.
