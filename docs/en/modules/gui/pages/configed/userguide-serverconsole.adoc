[[opsi-manual-configed-serverconsole]]
= Server Console

You can initiate actions on the opsi server from `opsi-configed` using an SSH connection through the _Server console_ menu option. When you click on this menu item, you can first check if you are already connected to the server via SSH (_Start SSH connection directly_ checkbox in the login dialog). Below this, there are options to update the SSH connection details and to modify the predefined command line commands listed under the _opsi_ menu item. Hover your mouse over an entry to see a tooltip with more information.

[[opsi-manual-configed-serverconsole-ssh]]
== SSH Connection Data

`opsi-configed` defaults to using the currently logged-in user's credentials for the opsi-configserver to establish the SSH connection. Through the _Server console_ menu, selecting _SSH connection data_ opens a dialog where you can enable the _Use SSH key for authentication_ checkbox and select an SSH key to upload. If the key is protected by a passphrase, enter it in the provided field.

.*opsi-configed*: SSH Connection Data
image::configed_ssh.png["*opsi-configed*: SSH Connection Data", pdfwidth=80%]

Alternatively, you can specify the SSH key and passphrase at startup using the following two parameters (refer to the section xref:gui:configed/userguide.adoc#opsi-configed-start-parameter[Start Parameters]):

* `--ssh-key <path-to-key>`, e.g. `--ssh-key /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa`
* `--ssh-passphrase <passphrase>`

[[opsi-manual-configed-serverconsole-permissions]]
== Authorizations

You can manage visibility of menu items and user permissions through server host parameters (see section xref:gui:configed/userguide-server.adoc#opsi-manual-configed-hostproperties-server[Server Host Parameters]). If the opsi extension xref:opsi-modules:user-roles.adoc[User Roles] is activated, you can specify authorizations for various user accounts, with default values set for new accounts.

Available entries include:

[source,console]
----
user.{}.ssh.serverconfiguration.active
user.{}.ssh.commandmanagement.active
user.{}.ssh.menu_serverconsole.active
user.{}.ssh.commands.active
----

They mean:

* Activates the menu for SSH connection settings (default: `false`).
* Enables editing of command line command menu entries (default: `false`).
* Enables the main menu entry _Server console_ (default: `true`).
* Enables all SSH menu entries representing stored commands (default: `true`).

[[opsi-manual-configed-serveractions-parametercommands]]
== Pre-defined Commands

The menu _Server console_ / _opsi_ contains pre-defined command line commands that perform the following actions:

* _opsi-package-updater_: Install or update packages with the xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-package-updater[*opsi-package-updater*]. In the dialog that opens, select either _Update packages_ , _List all repositories_ or _Install packages_ from the _Action_ drop-down menu. You can select the package repository in the drop-down menu below.

* _Install package_: Install opsi packages with the xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-package-manager[*opsi-package-manager*] on one or more depots. You can either enter the local path to a package or download one from the internet.

* _Uninstall package_: Select one or more packages you want to uninstall with the `opsi-package-manager`.

* _Pack opsi package_: Specify a directory on the server that contains files for an opsi package. You can use a button to display the versions found in the `control` file (package and product version) and overwrite them if necessary. Click on _Advanced settings_ to display checkboxes that you can use to create Zsync or Md5 files and set the subsequent permissions. The button _Install the built package_ invokes the `opsi-package-manager`.

* _Download a file_: Download any file from the Internet using `wget` and place it on the server in the directory of your choice.

* _Upload module file_: Upload an activation file for opsi extensions to the server. Select the file from your local machine or download it with `wget`. If necessary, you can enter credentials fot the `wget` command.

* _Set opsi rights_: Corrects the access rights of files and directories on an opsi server by invoking the xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-set-rights[*opsi-set-rights*] command.

* _Deployment of opsi client agent_: To include existing computers as clients in the opsi environment, the client agent must be installed on them. Here you can select the machines. To execute the command on several clients simultaneously, the login data on these machines must be the same.

NOTE: The script for deploying the clients must be located in the `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent` directory and be called `opsi-deploy-client-agent` (see chapter xref:first-steps:clients/client-installation.adoc[Adding Clients]).

Some of the dialogs (e.g. _Set opsi rights_ or _Install package_) contain buttons to select local files. Press the _Find subfolders_ button to list all files and directories from the specified path. To include more layers, press the button multiple times.

[[opsi-manual-configed-serverconsole-commandcontrol]]
== Defining Commands

You can open the _Edit commands_ dialog to set up your own commands which will then be available in the _Server console_ menu. 

NOTE: Please be aware that not all Linux distributions use the same commands or parameters. As an administrator, ensure that the Linux distribution for your opsi server supports the specific commands you plan to use.

.*opsi-configed*: Defining Commands
image::configed_serverkonsole-defcommands.png["*opsi-configed*: Defining Commands", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

In the _Edit commands_ dialog, you can configure the following:

* _Menu text of the command_: Ensure the text for the menu entry is unique and not used elsewhere. If you need to modify an existing command, delete it using the minus sign icon and create a new one. (mandatory setting)

* _Parent menu_: This field specifies under which menu the new command should appear. Leaving this field empty will default the command to appear under the _Server console_ menu. (optional setting)

* _Description_: Any description entered here will be displayed as a tooltip for the command. (optional setting)

* _Position_: Determines the order of the menu items. Items are sorted with smaller numbers appearing first. This setting helps organize commands within their respective menus. (optional setting)

* _Root access required_: Check this box if the command requires administrative privileges to execute. (optional setting)

* _List of commands_: Here, input the Linux commands, each on a new line. These commands will be executed sequentially. (mandatory setting)

There are various optional data sources available for enhancing the command list, accessible through the _Insert parameter into command line_ dropdown menu:

- Interactive input: No fixed parameters; instead, allow for interactive inputs formatted as `<<<"Interactive Input">>>`. It's recommended to include an example of the input expected.
- Config server
- IP addresses of the selected clients
- IP addresses of the selected depots 
- Names of the selected clients
- Names of the selected depots
- Select options for script
- Connected SSH server

NOTE: Except for interactive inputs, the returns from these methods can be formatted, such as in a comma-separated list.

.*opsi-configed*: Execute Command, Parameter Query
image::configed_serverkonsole-exec.png["*opsi-configed*: Execute command, parameter query", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

TIP: You can use operators such as AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), the pipe character (`|`), and redirection (`>`, `<`, `>>`) with the Linux commands. Remember that no user input is possible during execution. If youâ€™re combining commands and the first requires root privileges, ensure the root rights required checkbox is checked. If the subsequent command also needs root privileges, include `sudo` in the command syntax.
