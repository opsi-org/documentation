= User Interface

After successfully logging in, you will see the main window of `opsi-configed`. Below the menu bar on the left, there is a group of icons. From left to right, these icons allow you to reload all data, create new opsi clients, open a search mask for clients, save changed configurations, filter the client display, check which clients are connected, and retrieve session information.

On the right side, there is also a group of icons. The first set of three icons selects the mode (see section <<opsi-manual-configed-mode-selection>>). The five icons to the right each open separate dialogs for managing client groups and products, a dashboard, an overview of installed opsi extensions, and the xref:opsi-modules:licensemanagement.adoc[License Management].

TIP: From almost all sections, you can copy data to the clipboard and paste it into other applications. Additionally, most `opsi-configed` tables support drag and drop, allowing you to conveniently transfer table data to a spreadsheet application.

== Light and Dark Theme

Starting with opsi 4.3, `opsi-configed` supports a dark mode. To activate it, open the _File_ menu and select _Theme_ / _Dark_.

To switch back to the light theme, select _Theme_ / _Light_ from the _File_ menu.

NOTE: `opsi-configed` stores several settings on the local computer (where you launched the program), including the chosen theme, the last selected clients/groups, and depots. Thus, you will find the same settings upon restarting the program.

== Selecting the Mode

Use the three icons on the top right (see <<opsi-configed-toolbar-right.png>>) to switch between different modes:

* xref:gui:configed/userguide-clients.adoc[Clients]
* xref:gui:configed/userguide-depots.adoc[Depots]
* xref:gui:configed/userguide-server.adoc[Servers]

Depending on your selection, the main window view changes, and different tabs are visible/active or appropriately grayed out.
