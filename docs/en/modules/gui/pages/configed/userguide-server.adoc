[[opsi-manual-configed-server]]
= Server

Click on the icon _Server configuration_ in the top to open the _Host parameters_ tab in the mein window. It displays the server defaults of the host parameters.

== Server Host Parameters

Displaying and editing host parameters for the server works the same as for clients (xref:gui:configed/userguide-clients.adoc#opsi-manual-configed-hostproperties[Host Parameters: Client and Server Configuration]). Click in the _Property value_ column and make your adjustments in the dialog box that opens.

=== Managing User Rights and Roles

If the opsi extension xref:opsi-modules:user-roles.adoc[User Roles] is active, you can edit it in the serverâ€™s host parameters with `opsi-configed`.

NOTE: This is a paid extension. This means that you need an activation file to unlock it. You will receive this file after you have purchased the extension. For evaluation purposes, we're happy to provide you with a temporary license free of charge. Please contact us via mailto:info@uib.de[email].

In the tree view, you might see the entry _user_, but this does not mean the function is active. The default value for `user.{}.register` is `false`. Set this to `true` and deploy the modules file to activate the feature (temporarily or permanently). Afterwards, an entry for the logged-in user is created in the tree structure. The default settings used for rights management correspond to the "classic" specifications for an administrator. There are no restrictions for this role. For example, if the account is named `admindepot1`, it would appear like this:

[source,console,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
user.{admindepot1}.privilege.host.all.registered_readonly       [false]
user.{admindepot1}.privilege.host.depotaccess.configured        [false]
user.{admindepot1}.privilege.host.depotaccess.depots            []
user.{admindepot1}.privilege.host.opsiserver.write              [true]
----

These four entries mean:

* The user does *not* have read-only access; read-only access might be suitable for a helpdesk employee.
* There are no restrictions regarding the depot (or these are not considered).
* Consequently, the list of depots accessible to the user can remain empty. Even if something were entered here, it would have no effect as long as `depotaccess.configured` is set to `false`.
* The user is allowed to edit settings of all kinds.

If you want the user `admindepot1` to only have access to the computers of the depot server named `depot1`, you can configure it like this:

* Set `user.\{admindepot1}.privilege.host.depotaccess.configured` to `true`.
* In the list for the value `user.\{admindepot1}.privilege.host.depotaccess.depots`, enter `depot1`.

After reloading all data, `admindepot1` will no longer see clients from other depots. Additionally, they can only change settings for `depot1`.

CAUTION: Users can lift all restrictions themselves as long as the setting `host.opsiserver.write` is set to `true`. Change the value to `false` to completely secure the settings.

NOTE: The privileges set up in this way apply exclusively to the functionality of `opsi-configed`. They currently have no impact on the JSON-RPC interface of the opsi server.

The remaining entries that appear in the tree view pertain to the configuration of the server console (see chapter xref:gui:configed/userguide-serverconsole.adoc[Server Console]).
