= Groups and Products

This chapter introduces the two dialogs that you can use to perform actions for client groups and products/packages in `opsi-configed`.

[[opsi-manual-configed-groupactions]]
== Actions for Client Groups

Click the _Groups (special functions)_ button in the top right to open a new dialog where you can define actions for client groups (see section xref:gui:configed/userguide-clients.adoc#opsi-manual-configed-treeview[Grouping Clients]). Currently, there is only one available function: searching for an operating system previously installed on all PCs in the selected group, which can then be restored.

== Actions for Products/Packages

Next to the group actions button, you will find the _Products (special functions)_ icon, which also opens a separate dialog window. There are two functions available here:

* You can select an `.opsi` file (an opsi package) or manually enter the path to the file. You can then upload the package to the opsi server. The standard workbench (network share) is pre-selected as the destination directory. The icon below the input field initiates the package installation command.

* In the bottom half of the window, you can upload WinPE files or installation files for a Windows product to the server. The default directory for the opsi depot is the standard share.
