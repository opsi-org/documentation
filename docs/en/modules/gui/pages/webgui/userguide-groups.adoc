[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-groups]]
= Managing groups

The client groups can be managed on the *Groups* page.
The actions available for groups are

- Create subgroup
- Edit group properties (description and notes)
- Add or remove clients from a group
- Remove group including subgroups

The actions available for assigning clients and groups are

- Assign clients to one or more groups
- Remove clients

NOTE: Please note the different functionality of the top-level groups 'groups' and 'clientdirectory'. The latter allows a client to be assigned to only one group; if this has not been done explicitly, this client appears in the subgroup `not_assigned`. In contrast, a client can be assigned to several subgroups in the `groups` group.
