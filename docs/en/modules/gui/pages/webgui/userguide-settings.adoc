= Settings

In the WebGUI's settings you can adjust the language and theme of the application as well as (de)activate quick saving and multiple selection. For an enhanced user experience, your preferences are saved as described in <<opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-settings-cookies>>.

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-settings-language]]
== Language

The {opsi-webgui} supports multiple languages; as of {date}, these include German, English, and French. You can change the language settings of the web application via the Quick Panel by selecting the globe icon.

Alternatively, you can decide on a different language before logging in; you will find the switch in the footer of the login page. The default language is English.

NOTE: You can help us with localisation by adding and improving existing translations or adding a completely new language. Visit our link:https://explore.transifex.com/opsi-org/opsiorg/[Transifex project page] and help us find the right words.

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-settings-theme]]
== Theme

The WebGUI's default theme is _Light_ (white background with dark text). We also supply the _Dark_ theme, which shows light-coloured text on a dark background. To change the theme, click on the _Light_ or _Dark_ icon in the Quick Panel and then select the desired look from the drop-down menu.
To change the theme, click the Theme dropdown in the Quick Panel.

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-settings-quicksave]]
== Quick Save

This feature allows you to decide whether configuration changes should be saved instantly or at a later time. By default, the _Quick save_ option is enabled, meaning changes are applied right away. If you deactivate this option, changes are initially saved locally. You can then edit or discard these changes before saving them permanently.

You can use this function in the following contexts:

* When editing parameters for the opsi config server and opsi client.
* When modifying products, including actions like install, uninstall, update, etc.
* During the editing of product properties.

If you disable the _Quick save_ option, the upper menu shows a new button _Track changes_.
