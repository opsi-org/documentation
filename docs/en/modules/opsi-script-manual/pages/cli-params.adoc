[[opsi-script-cliparams]]
== Command Line Options

Since version 4.11.3, the _opsi-script_ program contains at Windows a manifest with the statement: +
`<requestedExecutionLevel level="highestAvailable" />`. This means that if _opsi-script_ is called on an NT6 OS by an Administrator, then it will run as an 'elevated' process. If _opsi-script_ is called with normal user privileges, then it will run with the privileges of this user.

If you start _opsi-script_ without any parameter, it will start in the interactive mode.

_opsi-script_ can be started with different sets of parameters depending on context and purpose of use.

Note:: At Linux or macOS the parameter char is not "/" as here described for Windows but "-". So instead of using  `opsi-script /help` as we do on Windows, we use at Linux / macOS `opsi-script -help`.

Generic Options:

* `/?` or `/h`[elp] +
Show help +

* `/silent` +
Run opsi-script without GUI +


Execute one (or more) scripts: +
`opsi-script` <scriptfile>[;<scriptfile>]* [<logfile>] +
where: +
<scriptfile> = Name of the script file (incl. path). +
<logfile> = Name of the logfile (incl. path).
Paths to logfiles see also: <<opsi-script-logpath>>

* `/parameter` <parameterstring> +
A string that can be passed to the executed script and can be retrevaled by the command `Paramstr`. +
Hereby is <parameterstring> a string without whitespaces.

* `/logfile` <logfile>  +
Define the logfile: +
Hereby is: +
<logfile> = Name of the logfile (incl. path).
Paths to logfiles see also: <<opsi-script-logpath>>

* `/lang` <lang> +
Define the localization: +
Hereby is: +
<lang> = The two char language abbreviation (de,en,fr,es,...)

* `/batch` +
Execute the given script with the batch GUI. The batch GUI has no possibility for user interaction. In combination with the option `/silent` there will be no GUI at all. If you call _opsi-script_ without the option `/batch` the interactive GUI ist started, which is designed for development end testing purposes.

* `/testsyntax` (since 4.12.7.) +
Execute the given script in 'testsyntax' mode.
Normally used in combination with the parameter `/batch`. +
see also:  xref:opsi-script-manual:cli-params.adoc[]

* `/productid` <productId> +
For the use together with `/servicebatch` ; see below.

* `/servicebatch` +
Execute the given script with the batch GUI and with a connection to the opsi web service. Thereby the given script will be executed as it would be if the opsi product given by the option `/productid` had the action request 'setup'. +
The script file has to be the first option. +
The option `/opsiservice` and its sub options has to be given. +
The option `/productid` has to be given. This one is used for the communication with the opsi web service to run the given script as it would be the 'setup-script' of the opsi product given with this option.

* `/logproductid` <productId> +
While creating the logfile the given <productId> should be used to note it as source of the logfile.

* `/normalwindow` +
Switches off the maximize if of the GUI in the not interactive mode.

* `/usercontext` < [domain\]username > +
If the given user is loged in then _opsi-script_ will try to resolve the constants like `%CurrentAppdataDir%, %CurrentStartmenuDir%, %CurrentDesktopDir%, %CurrentStartupDir%, %CurrentProgramsDir%, %CurrentSendToDir%, %CurrentProfileDir%` from the context of the given user. +
Mostly used together with the'User Profile Management' opsi extension.


* `/opsiservice` <opsiserviceurl> +
     `/clientid` <clientname> +
     `/username` <username> +
     `/password` <password> +
     [`/sessionid` <sessionid>] +
     [`/credentialfile` <credentialfile>] +
Give the connection data to connect to the opsi web service: +
Hereby you have to give either `/clientid` and `/username` and `/password`
and also optional the `/sessionid` +
or you have to give this data via a
 `/credentialfile`.

Declare what should be done in the context of the connected  `/opsiservice` +

* Default (none of the following parameters): +
Process the action requests as they stored for this client on the opsi-server.

* `/allloginscripts` or `/loginscripts` +
Process the login scripts of the opsi products. Using  `/allloginscripts` all login scripts that are known to the opsi-Server will be processed, no matter iftheses products are known to the client or not. Using `/loginscripts` only these login scripts will be precessed that belong to products that are installed or were installed and then removed (technical: there is an existing productOnClient object).

* `/productlist` <productid>[,<productid>]* +
Process the given `/productlist` in a way as it would normally done if there are the action request 'setup' is stored at the opsi-server. +
Usally used by the `event_silent_install`.

* `/processproducts` <productid>[,<productid>]* +
Process the action requests as they stored for this client on the opsi-Server but limited to the list of products given by `/processproducts`.



[[opsi-script-logpath]]
== Logfile and Paths

The default logfile name is `opsi-script.log`.
You may find (by default) up to 8 backup copys of old logfiles: from `opsi-script_0.log` until `opsi-script_8.log`. +
The default number of backups may be overwritten by using the config: xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc[]

The logfile encoding is UTF-8.

By default logfiles are written at Windows into the directory `c:\opsi.org\log` which _opsi-script_ tries to create. If _opsi-script_ has no access to this directory it uses the user-TEMP directory.

At Linux:
If running as `root` (default): `/var/log/opsi-script`
If running as any other user: `/tmp`

The logfile name and location will be overwritten via the specific command line option.

In the case, that _opsi-script_ executes a script in `/batch` mode and with a specified (and working) usercontext, the default logging path is the `opsi/tmp` in the appdata directory of the user. This will be overwritten by an explicit given log path.

More possibilities to configure the logging: +
see also: xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc#opsi-script-configs_writeProductLogFile[] +
see also: xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc#opsi-script-configs_default_loglevel[] +
see also: xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc#opsi-script-configs_force_min_loglevel[] +
see also: xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc[] +
see also: xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc[] +

Beside the normal logfile there is also a logfile named `opsi-script.history`. This logfile contains one line for every run of a product script since the first run.
These lines have the pattern: +
`<timestamp> handled: <productid> Version: <version> Request: <request> Result: <result>` +
Example: +
`2022-01-18 00:09  handled : gimp Version: 2.10.30-1 Request: setup Result: success` +

[[opsi-script-exitcodes]]
== Exit Codes

opsi-script has (since 4.12.7.0) the following exit codes: +

* *0* : +
The opsi-script program was terminated without any internal errors and all executed scripts ran successfully.

* *1* : +
The opsi-script program was terminated without any internal errors, but one (or more) executed scripts did not run successfully (`failed`).

* *>1* : +
An internal error has occurred in the opsi-script program (this should not happen). Script execution probably failed.


[[opsi-script-testsyntax]]
== Checking the Script Syntax

Available since 4.12.7.0

If opsi-script is started in `testsyntax` mode, scripts will not be executed but scanned for syntax errors. +
Such a `testsyntax` run has the following characteristic features:

* While running in `testsyntax` mode *every* line of the script will be processed. So for example in case of an if-else-endif statement both branches will be analyzed.

* Any statement that will modify the system opsi-script is running on, will *not* be executed.

* If a syntax error is found, this will be logged. The run will not stop at the first syntax error but run to the end. So you will find every syntax error in the log.

* Every statement that normally stops the script execution (like `isFatalError`) will be ignored.

* In the header of the logfile, you will find the warning: +
`Running in TestSyntax mode !!`.

* If a syntax error is found, the script will be marked as `failed`. This means in detail:

** The logfile will end up with `script finished: failed`.

** The opsi-script process will return the exit code *1*.

** If opsi-script is started in the context of the opsi web-service (so for example started by the management interface via `on_demand`), the opsi product will be marked as: State: `unknown` and Report either `ok: testsyntax` or `failed: testsyntax`.

NOTE: After you checked a script with `testsyntax`, you may find additional runtime error messages in the logfile. You should ignore these runtime errors. In many cases these runtime errors are side effects of the `testsyntax` run. The reason is, that while `testsyntax` many variables have empty (or other unexpected) values.


In order to run opsi-script in `testsyntax` mode, you have the following possibilities:

.opsi-script in interactive mode
image::opsi-script-interactive.png["Screenshot: opsi-script in interactive mode", pdfwidth=90%]


* *Interactive* : +
If opsi-script is started in the interactive mode, use the button `Test Syntax` (instead of `Start`) to run the selected script.

* *In the context of the opsi web-service* : +
By using the config ('Hostparameter') `opsi-script.global.testsyntax` = `true`, opsi-script will be forced to run all scripts in the 'testsyntax' mode. +
ATTENTION: Switch this config only for selected computers to `true`. Do not forget to switch it back to `false` after you have done your syntax check! +
see also:  xref:opsi-script-manual:configuration-options.adoc[]

* *Command line parameter* : +
If you call opsi-script on the command line, use the additional parameter `/testsyntax` in order to run the given script in `testsyntax` mode. +
