The output of the PowerShell command `Get-Partition` contains NULL characters `\u0000` in the column `DriveLetter` where there is no drive letter. This leads in opsi-script to problems with directly reading the output of `Get-Partition`. If you like to use the output of `Get-Partition` in your script, we recommend the solution:
+
[source,opsiscript]
----
DefStringlist $ResultList$
PowershellCall('Get-Partition > "%opsiUserTmpDir%\Get-Partition.txt"')
Set $ResultList$ = LoadTextFile("%opsiUserTmpDir%\Get-Partition.txt")
----
Here, the output of `Get-Partition` is written to a file first and so the problem with the NULL characters is handled.
