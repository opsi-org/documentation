[[opsi-setup-detector-use-quickstart]]
== opsi-setup-detector Quickstart

After the first start of the opsi-setup-detector a configuration mask appears.
The following information is required:

* `fullname`:   (Used for entries in the changelog.txt)

* `email_address`:  (Used for entries in the changelog.txt)

* `workbench_path`: Path to the directory in which the opsi packages are going to be created. +
This is ideally the path to the place where the `opsi_workbench` of your opsi-Server is mounted.

[[opsi-setup-detector-introduction]]
== Introduction: opsi-setup-detector - What is this ?

The creation of opsi-packages from available setup programs is
a recurring task when operating opsi.
The opsi-setup-detector should help you to simplify this in two ways:

* Detection of the type of the setup program and the determination of the necessary command line parameters

* Creation of an opsi package with the necessary scripts for installation and deinstallation.

* If necessary, include the opsi-package-builder for further processing of the provided package or to build and install the package.

Most setup programs are not written by the developers themselves,
but are based on different frameworks. The opsi-setup-detector now tries to find patterns in the setup program which are specific for certain frameworks and to recognize the framework on the basis of these and thus to determine the necessary information.

This can lead to you getting a finished opsi package with just a few clicks. Often you get an opsi-package to which you have to add further information after the first installation of the program (e.g. with the created opsi-package).

Of course there can also be problems.
The most common are described in the chapter <<opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting>>
There is also described how you can help us to improve the opsi-setup-detector after solving a problem.

[[opsi-setup-detector-installation]]
== Installation of the opsi-setup-detector and  opsi-package-builder

// include docu: opsi-logviewer installation
include::common:partial$opsi-logviewer-installation.adoc[]


[[opsi-setup-detector-prerequires]]
== Requirements in order to use the opsi-setup-detector

Recommendation:

* You should have mounted the share `opsi_workbench` of your opsi-Server on your computer.

* Ideally you should have the opsi-Package-Builder installed on your computer.

[[opsi-setup-detector-opb-integration]]
== Integration of the opsi-package-builder through the opsi-setup-detector

.opsi-setup-detector Create and Build Modes
image::osd_page_create_modes_with_opb_en.png["Create and Build Modes", pdfwidth=90%]

On the tab `Create Mode` you will find a selection for the creation mode.
The default is `create opsi product files`.

If you choose one of the other modes, an installed `opsi-package-builder` will be called.

In case of `... and build package` the `opsi-package-builder` is called in the background to build the directory created by the opsi-setup-detector with the opsi files to a package. The checkboxes 'Build Mode' can be used to select whether the build should be 'silent', if the package should be built and if the built package should be installed.

Without any of these options, this call corresponds to the last build mode:
'... and start interactive PackageBuilder'.

[[opsi-setup-detector-use-double-analyze-and-create]]
=== Opsi-setup-detector: Analyze two setup files (32 and 64 bit) and create one opsi package

.opsi-setup-detector Result of the analysis of the second setup program
image::osd_page_setup2_en.png["Result of analysis 2", pdfwidth=90%]

This item corresponds to the `Analyze file and create an opsi package` described above with the following addition: +
Two setup programs for the 32 and 64 bit architectures are queried and analyzed. The product gets an additional property: `install_architecture` with the possible values: `32bitonly`, `64bitonly`, `both`, `systemspecific`.

[[opsi-setup-detector-use-single-analyze-only]]

[[opsi-setup-detector-use-template-create]]
=== Opsi-setup-detector: Create an opsi package template

This item corresponds to the `Analyze file and create an opsi package` described above with the following restriction: +
it does not ask for a setup file and therefore the analysis is not necessary. Rather a general script template is created.

[[opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting]]
== opsi-setup-detector: Problems and solutions

The opsi-setup-detector is designed in such a way that it is as easy as possible to be continuously maintained and expanded. +
Certain customization options and help with problems are presented in the following. +
If you have ideas and / or wishes beyond that, please contact us at (info@uib.de) - we are looking forward to your suggestions.

[[opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting-logging]]
=== Logging

The opsi-setup-detector creates logfiles under
`c:\opsi.org\applog\opsisetupdetector.log`. +
Older logfiles are located in the same directory as `opsisetupdetector_0.log` to `opsisetupdetector_8.log`.

The logfile becomes very large because it contains the complete data of the analysis of the setup file(s). For the analysis of the logfile we recommend the `opsi-log-viewer` or another editor which can hide the unneeded log levels, because the text patterns found in the setup (on log level 8) in many cases are not so relevant.

[[opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting-lang]]
=== Language support

When the program is started, the language of the Windows system is automatically determined. If a suitable language file is found for the language, it is used. If no supported language is found, English is used. +
You can select the language via the menu item `Languages` or via the command line parameter `--lang=xx` where `xx` stands for the selected language.

Currently the 'opsi setup detector' supports : +

* German
* English
* French
* Spanish (incomplete)

Additional languages can be easily added to be translated via a language file. +
Translations are done via the portal:
https://www.transifex.com/opsi-org/ +
We look forward to your support

[[opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting-unknown-installer]]
=== Unknown Installer

Surely you will come across the message `Unknown Installer` while working with the opsi-setup-detector. Then the opsi-setup-detector did not recognize the installer framework with which this installer was made. +
Suggestions: +

* Check if the file is really an installer. (Sounds stupid, but it happened to me already)

* Search the Internet for the keywords 'silent' and product name

* Maybe the links on this page will help you: +
https://forum.opsi.org/wiki/doku.php?id=userspace:software_integration_web_links

Once you have solved the problem, let us, (and the opsi community) know about experience. +
The new (internal) design of the opsi-setup-detector makes it possible to easily add new installers. What we need is : +

* Example setup program

* Manufacturer or typical command line Switch for installation and uninstallation

* Informative links to the problem

[[opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting-wrong-installer]]
=== False detection

Especially in the context of the increasing number of supported (i.e. detected) installers, false detection can occur. +
This happens especially when an installer contains several software components which are packed with different installers. +
Should you discover such a problem, please inform us and have the appropriate example and the correct solution ready.

[[opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting-bugs]]
=== Program error

If the opsi-setup-detector behaves strangely or does something unexpected, please backup the corresponding logfile from `c:\opsi.org\applog\` (see also: <<opsi-setup-detector-troubleshooting-logging>>) and inform us about the problem at info@uib.de. Also have the sample file ready, as we may need it to reproduce the problem.
