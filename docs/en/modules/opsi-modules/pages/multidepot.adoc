= opsi-Server with multiple depots (free)

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-concept]]
== Concept

Supporting multiple depot shares in opsi aims at the following targets:

* central configuration data storage and configuration management

* providing the software depots on local servers

* automated deployment of software packages from the central server to the local depots

Accordingly, it is implemented:

* All configuration data is stored on the central 'opsi-Configserver'.

* All clients connect to this 'opsi-Configserver' in order to request their configuration data. The configuration data comprise the information on method and target of the 'opsi-Depotserver' connection.

* All installable software is stored on 'opsi-Depotservers'.

* The 'opsi-Depotservers' have as well an `opsipxeconfd` running by which they provide boot-images to clients via PXE/tftp.

* `opsi-package-manager` +
A program to (de-)install opsi packages on one ore more 'opsi-Depotservers'.

* The opsi packages are copied via webdav protocol to the 'opsi-Depotservers' and are installed from the opsiconfd via a web service call.

* 'opsi-configed' supports the management of multiple depots.

* Clients connected to different depots can be managed in one bundle if the involved depots are synchronized (have all product packages in identical versions).

The following schema gives a more detailed view on the communication between the components of a opsi multi depot share environment.

[[opsi-manual-multidepot-installation]]
== Creating an depot server

In order to create an 'opsi-Depotserver' you have to install a standard 'opsi-Server'. This 'opsi-Server' can be configured to act as 'opsi-Depotserver' by calling the script `opsiconfd setup --register-depot` as user root on the server which should become the 'opsi-Depotserver'. Because this script does not only reconfigure the local server, but also registers this server as 'opsi-Depotserver' with the central 'opsi-Configserver', username and password of a member of the 'opsiadmin' group have to be supplied here.

On Univention Corporate Server the registration of a 'opsi-Depotserver' happens automatically.
The first server with an opsi installation is used as 'opsi-Configserver' and all following in a UCS domain installed systems will register
there as an 'opsi-Depotserver'.

Example: +
'opsidepot.your.domain' will be reconfigured as opsi-Depotserver and registered at the opsi-Configserver 'opsiserver.your.domain':
[source,shell]
----
root@opsidepot.your.domain:~# opsiconfd setup --register-depot
----
Now you will be prompted for the opsi-Configserver you want to connect to . The registration needs to be authorised by
supplying the username and password of a member of the group 'opsiadmin' at the opsi-Configserver.

The setup will ask you questions about the server, the user, the password and the description of the depot.
In the end the output should look like this:
[source,shell]
----
root@opsidepot:~$ opsiconfd setup --register-depot
Do you want to register this server as a depotserver? [y/n]: y
Enter opsi server address or service url (opsiserver.your.domain): 
Enter username for service connection: adminuser
Enter password for 'adminuser': 
Connecting to service 'https://opsiserver.your.domain:4447'
Connected to service as 'adminuser'
Enter ID of the depot (opsidepot.your.domain): 
Enter a description for the depot (opsidepot): opsidepot
Registering depot
Depot succesfully registered
----

Usually the configuration files in `/etc/opsi/package-updater.repos.d/` on the new depot should be checked.

If the new depot should only update its packages from the main server, only the repository in `/etc/opsi/package-updater.repos.d/opsi-server.repo` should remain active.
A possible configuration can look like this:

----
[repository_opsi_server]
active = true
opsiDepotId = opsiserver.your.domain
autoInstall = true
autoUpdate = true
autoSetup = false
; Inherit ProductProperty defaults from master repository
inheritProductProperties = false
----


[[opsi-manual-multidepot-installation-unattended]]
=== Non-interactive registration of a opsi-Depotserver

Since opsi-Depotserver 4.0.7.2 it is possible to register a depot without interaction.

To do this the data for the connection to the opsi-Configserver has to be passed as JSON object alongside the parameter `--unattended`.

[source,shell]
----
opsiconfd setup --register-depot --unattended '{"address": "config.server.address:4447/rpc", "username": "adminuserinopsi", "password": "pwoftheuser", "depot_id": "depotname", "description": "Added with unattended registration."}'
----

The opsi-Depotserver will be created with defaults.

xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-package-updater[opsi-package-updater]

In or to manage opsi-packages with different 'opsi-Depotserver' the `opsi-package-manager` got the option `-d` ( or `--depot`). With this option you can give the target 'opsi-Depotserver' for the installation. Using the keyword 'ALL' the opsi package will be copied to `/var/lib/opsi/repository` on all known 'opsi-Depotservers' and then installed via a web service call.

If you don't give the option `-d`, the opsi package will be only installed on the local server (without upload to `/var/lib/opsi/repository`).

Example: +
Install the package +softprod_1.0-5.opsi+ on all known 'opsi-Depotservers':
[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-manager -d ALL -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

In order to get information's about what are the differences between depots you may call `opsi-package-manager` with the option `-D` (or `--differences`).

Example: +
Show the differences between all known depots regarding the product +mshotfix+
[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-manager -D -d ALL mshotfix
mshotfix
