[[software-on-demand]]
= opsi Software On Demand - opsi-client-kiosk (free)

[[software-on-demand_introduction]]
== Introduction

With the module "Software-on-Demand" opsi administrators may give their users access to install a range of software-products.
These software products may be selected and installed user-driven without the administrator needing to do anything.
This documentation shows how the module "Software-on-Demand" works, describes it's functions and how to configure it.

*Conventions:* When the opsi-client-kiosk/agent in general is mentioned, it refers to all OS versions (Windows/Linux) unless stated otherwise. When talking about packages or products then the opsi-client-kiosk/agent package/product is the Windows package/product and the l-opsi-client-kiosk or opsi-linux-client-agent package/product is the Linux package/product.

[[software-on-demand_prerequisits]]
== Prerequisites

There are some preconditions needed for the usage of this extension.
The product-groups are needed, available with opsi 4.0.
Furthermore the opsi-client-agent and the opsi-configed at version 4.0.1 are needed.

NOTE: Windows: Starting with opsi-client-agent version 4.1.1.6-5 the kiosk is available as a standalone package (opsi-client-kiosk). It will be however installed during the installation of the opsi-client-agent if it's not already present. For more details please check <<software-on-demand_opsi-client-kiosk, New opsi-client-kiosk application>>


.Required Packages
[options="header"]
|==========================
|opsi-package|version
|opsi-client-agent / opsi-linux-client-agent|>=4.1.0.0-36,  >=4.1.1.6-5** / >= 4.1.1.11-1
|opsi-winst / opsi-script|>=4.10.8.12
|python-opsi|>=4.1.1.71-1
|opsi-server|>=4.0.1-2
|opsi-configed|>=4.0.1.6-1
|(l-)opsi-client-kiosk|>=4.1.1.7-6
|==========================
**opsi-client-kiosk as a standalone package

[[software-on-demand_configuration-parameter]]
== Configuration

The configuration of this extension is based on product-groups and config-variables.
The used config-variables are:

* software-on-demand.active
* software-on-demand.product-group-ids
* software-on-demand.admin-mode
* software-on-demand.installation-now-button

These config-variables are created with installing the opsi-server-package.

Since tne Kiosk version 4.1.1.11 and opsi-client-agent version 4.2.0.11-1 it's now possible to configure which event (`timer` or `on_demand`) should be triggered via the Kiosk for installations.

If necessary, the Config must first be created on the server side, e.g. via Configed in Server Configuration.
The value for the Config `opsiclientd.control_server.process_actions_event` can then be set via Configed (e.g. to `on_demand`).

Possible values are `auto`, `on_demand` and `timer`. `auto` is the default value. If `auto` is set then `timer` is used for WAN/VPN clients and `on_demand` for other clients.

WARNING: Starting from kiosk version >= 4.1.1.11 and opsi-client-agent version >= 4.2.0.11-1 the kiosk uses by default the caching and synchronization methods of the WAN/VPN-client if running on a WAN/VPN-client and with the `timer` event. In this case the config-variable `software-on-demand.installation-now-button` has to be set to `false`. Otherwise display and messages of the kiosk are not synchronized with the current client status.
To restore the old behaviour for WAN/VPN clients, the config `opsiclientd.control_server.process_actions_event` must be explicitly set to `on_demand`. Then WAN/VPN clients will also be triggered again by the `on_demand` event.

[[software-on-demand_product-group-management]]
=== Managing product-groups

The most comfortable way to create and manage product-groups is using the `opsi-configed`.
There you have to change to the tab `product configuration`.

TIP: Since version 4.0.1.6 of the `opsi-configed` you can change to `product configuration` without choosing a client.

The product-group menu is above the product list.

.product-group menue
image::configed_productgroup_en.png[pdfwidth=70%]

With the drop down menu you can choose a product-group to edit it.
If you have chosen a group, the corresponding products will be highlighted.
 +
With a second icon, filter can be activated or deactivated.
When a filter was activated, only the products of the activated product-group are seen.
 +
Product-groups can be edited after activating the icon with the yellow packets (show editor / hide editor) next to the icon with the filter.
In this view, a new group and it's description can be added. Save the editing by activating the red check icon.
 +
If some more products should be added to a group, select them and press the red check icon. (Press the <ctrl> button and select the products).

[[software-on-demand_configuration]]
=== configure the module Software-On-Demand

The module can be configured, as mentioned above, with the config-variables described in the following table:

.overview of the config-variables of the module Software-on-Demand
[options="header"]
|==========================
|Configuration|Description|Values
|software-on-demand.active|activates or deactivates the module, is used as a flag for the migration (<<software-on-demand_kiosk_migration, Nur Windows: Installation 체ber einen alten opsi-client-agent der den alten Kiosk noch enth채lt>>). It's irrelevant for the opsi-client-kiosk with version >=4.1.1.6-5. |true/false
|software-on-demand.product-group-ids|Product-groups with software-products, that can be used for Software-on-Demand.|List of product-groups
|software-on-demand.admin-mode|Enables specific functionality for admistrative purpose/setting icons/screenshots. Should be enabled only if needed (client-specific)|true/false
|software-on-demand.installation-now-button|Enables to install products immediately. Do NOT use on WAN/VPN-clients |true/false
|==========================

There are two ways to use these configuration objects.
For the whole system or for each client.
The following 2 chapters will explain both ways.

WARNING: Using the kiosk (Version>= 4.1.1.11) on a WAN/VPN-client the config-variable `software-on-demand.installation-now-button` has to be set to `false`. Otherwise display and messages of the kiosk are not synchronize with the current client status.

[[software-on-demand_systemwide-configuration]]
=== Configuration for the whole system

The configuration here is the default system wide for every client.
The configuration can be edited in the `opsi-configed`. Push the Button `Server Configuration` and change to the tab `Host Parameter`

.part of the module server configuration in the opsi configuration editor
image::configed_serverconfiguration_en.png[pdfwidth=70%]

Another possibility is to change the server-configuration with the following command:

[source, shell]
----
opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults
----

.edit-config-defaults with opsi-setup
image::editconfigdefaults.png[pdfwidth=70%]

TIP: Administration is also possible with the opsi-python-API or with 'opsi-admin'

[[software-on-demand_client-configuration]]
=== Configuration for a single client

The configuration for a single client - or client specific configuration - is useful if, for example, only some of the clients should have access to the Software-on-Demand extension. Or if you want to make several product groups available to some clients. +

The configuration of the client specific host parameters can be edited in different ways: +

The most comfortable way to edit the configuration is via 'opsi-configed'.
Choose one or several clients (even all clients of a client group if you want to)
and then navigate to the tab "Host parameters".

.edit hostparameter in the configuration editor
image::opsi-configed-hostparameters.png[pdfwidth=70%]

This editing overrides the system wide defaults.

////
[[software-on-demand_event-configuration]]
=== opsiclientd event-configuration

There are two ways for the users to start the software-installation:

* with the next system start
* immediately

If the user chooses "with the next system start", the product state will be set to "setup."
If the choice is "immediately", the 'opsiclientd' creates an event `software on demand`. This event can be configured in the file `opsiclientd.conf` as any other event.
////

[[software-on-demand_opsi-client-kiosk]]
== New opsi-client-kiosk application

*Windows*

With the opsi-client-agent version (>=4.1.1.6-5) the kiosk is available as a standalone product (opsi-client-kiosk) and will be installed as such when installing the opsi-client-agent. It tries to migrate the existing kiosk settings. +

Background of this changes are:

* simpler maintenance of the opsi-client-agent package
* Changes to the kiosk can be published independently from the opsi-client-agent package
* Allows to apply new settings of the kiosk to the clients without the need to reinstall the opsi-client-agent

NOTE: When installing the opsi-client-agent (>=4.1.1.6-5) on the depot, the opsi-client-kiosk package will be installed as well if necessary. For clients, when installing the opsi-client-agent (>=4.1.1.18-1) on the afore mentioned, the opsi-client-kiosk product is set to setup if necessary. For details see <<software-on-demand_kiosk_migration, Installation 체ber einen alten opsi-client-agent der den alten Kiosk noch enth채lt>>.

WARNING: The old (web based) Kiosk client no longer works with the new opsi-client-agent/opsiclientd.

*Linux*

The opsi-client-kiosk is also available under Linux as l-opsi-client-kiosk package or product.

[[software-on-demand_install]]
=== opsi-client-kiosk: Installation on a depot

If you invested time into customizing the kiosk, it's recommended to backup the custom directory before installing a new opsi-client-kiosk/opsi-client-agent on the depot: +
Kiosk as a standalone package (opsi-client-kiosk or l-opsi-client-kiosk): `/var/lib/opsi/depot/(l-)opsi-client-kiosk/files/app/ock_custom` +

Kiosk still integrated in opsi-client-agent package (only windows):
`/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/files/opsiclinetkiosk/app/ock_custom` or `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/files/opsiclinetkiosk/ock_custom` +
In rare cases also `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/files/opsiclinetkiosk/files_to_copy/ock_custom`

*First installation / installation over an already existing (l-)opsi-client-kiosk product*

Install the current (l-)opsi-client-kiosk package (available at download.uib.de) on the desired depot and update the opsi-(linux)-client-agent package if needed.

NOTE: opsi-client-agent package >=4.1.1.6-5 had to be installed on the depot as well as on the respective client.

[[software-on-demand_kiosk_migration]]
*Windows only: Installation through an old opsi-client-agent which still contains the old kiosk (i.e. contains the directory opsiclientkiosk, or \<=4.1.0.0)*

To minimize the number of manual changes or interactions, it is attempt to migrate the kiosk settings automatically from the opsi-client-agent to the opsi-client-kiosk package and install it on the depot or the corresponding clients if needed. Usually this is done automatically without the need of further interaction.

For a better understanding of the process described here in more detail, it's important to distinguish what happens during the installation of the opsi-client-agent on a depot and what happens during the installation on a client.

[underline]#Installation of the opsi-client-agent Version (>=4.1.1.6-5) on a Depot#

When installing opsi-client-agent on the depot, the opsi-client-kiosk package is installed on the depot if certain conditions are met. It tries to migrate the kiosk settings from the opsi-client-agent package to the opsi-client-kiosk package. This happens only if the following conditions are fulfilled:

* the opsi-client-kiosk package is NOT installed on the depot.
* the opsi-client-agent (>=4.1.1.6-5) is installed over an old opsi-client-agent that still contains the old kiosk (i.e. contains the directory opsiclientkiosk, \<=4.1.0.0)

[underline]#Installation of the opsi-client-agent Version (>=4.1.1.18-1) on a Client#

When installing the opsi-client-agent (>=4.1.1.18-1) on a client, the opsi-client-kiosk is set to setup under certain conditions. This happens when the following conditions are met:

* the opsi-client-kiosk is NOT installed on the client
* the config/host-parameter software-on-demand.active is set to true for this client

So in most cases the opsi-client-kiosk will be installed on the client automatically after the opsi-client-agent installation, due to the fact that the client PC will be rebooted and the opsi-clientd event gui_startup will be triggered which should be configured in most cases.

If the kiosk is not available on some clients, despite attempted automatic migration/installation, please check:

a. if an opsi-client-kiosk package is installed on the depot the client is connected to, if not install the opsi-client-kiosk package or the current opsi-client-agent package, respectively +
b. if the opsi-client-kiosk is installed on the client, should that not be the case please set it to setup



=== opsi-client-kiosk: Installation on a client

//If the opsi-client-agent during the installation notes that, the //configuration (Host Parameter): _software-on-demand.active_ is set to //_true_, it will automatically create a Start menu item during the //installation on the Client, on which the Kiosk application can be run //directly. It can be found under: _Start -> Programs -> opsi.org -> //software-on-demand_.

The installation on a client is controlled by the following 'opsi-client-kiosk' product properties:

* `startmenu_entry` +
The Start Menu entry for the opsi-client-kiosk (software on demand). +
Default=`software on demand`; editable

* `startmenu_folder` +
The Start Menu folder for the opsi-client-kiosk (opsi.org) +
Default=`opsi.org`; editable

* `desktop_icon` +
Create a desktop icon for opsi-client-kiosk ? +
Default=`false`

* `install_icon_collection` +
For adminsitrative purposes an icon collection can also be installed. It is only recommended though if product icons are to be set on the client via the kiosk admin mode and you want to select some of them from the icon collection. +
Default=`false`

The used icon for the start menu / Desktop may be modified by storing a `kiosk.ico` file (Windows) or `kiosk.png` file (Linux) at
`/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-kiosk/files/app/ock_custom/skin/` (since opsi-client-kiosk version 4.1.1.7-2).

.Window for the execution of the actions set
At this window (<<ock_image_actionwindow,Figure 12>>) you can execute an installation as from now (button `Installation now`). In this case it would be advisable to close all other applications (i.e. to save your data) because the started installations may come in conflict with currently running applications. +
Using the button `Install at next standard event (e.g. reboot)` closes the window and the actions will be proceed later at next standard event.

*Admin mode*

TIP: To execute the kiosk in the admin mode the config `software-on-demand.admin-mode = true` had to be set. In addition
the kiosk must be executed as administrator.

Using the kiosk in admin mode allow to set product icons and screenshots for the products. Therefore you need to click with the rigth mouse button on the icon or screenshot or its respective placeholder. This opens a file dialog from which the desired image can be chosen. This works within the main window as well as in the detailed prodcut view.
A click on the button image:opsi-client-kiosk_save_on_depot.png[title="Save on depot"] (<<ock_image_adminmode,Figure 13>>) opens a dialog to save the icons/screenshots on an opsi depot which means that these icons/screenshots are than also available for other kiosk installations.

image::opsi-client-kiosk_admin_mode.png["Kiosk - Admin mode"]

WARNING: After setting icons and screenshot within the kiosk the icons and screenshots are saved on the client only locally. To make these images available for kiosk installations on other clients they had to be copied to the ock-custom folder (e.g with the kiosk as described above).

NOTE: The config `software-on-demand.show-details` from opsi 4.0.7 has no effect on the kiosk anymore and can be deleted.

*Logs of the opsi-client-kiosk:* +

The program logs to `C:\opsi.org\applog`.


[[software-on-demand_notice]]
== Characteristics

The following apply to the software-on-demand module:

* Dependencies are resolved automatically +
   - Software that depends on software from the Demand group, will automatically be set to setup (install), without interaction from the user..

[[software-on-demand_CI]]
=== opsi-client-kiosk: Customizable to Corporate Identity

The header bar of the main window (1) is customizable. Three files in the ock_custom directory (`/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-kiosk/files/app/ock_custom/skin`) are key:

* `header.png`
* `logo.png`
* `opsiclientkiosk.ini`

The `header.png` contains the image which is loaded to the left of the logo in this area, `logo.png` the logo. +

The `opsiclientkiosk.ini` defines the text and its display, which will be shown in this area (Since opsi-client-kiosk version 4.1.1.7-2).


Example:

----
[TitleLabel]
Text= Softwarebasket
FontName = Arial
FontSize = 20
FontColor = $00ffffff
FontBold = true
FontItalic = false
FontUnderline = false
----

The applied desktop/startmenu icon can be changed by placing a `kiosk.ico` file (Windows) or `kiosk.png` file (Linux) in the ock_custom/skin directory (starting with opsi-client-kiosk version 4.1.1.7-2).
