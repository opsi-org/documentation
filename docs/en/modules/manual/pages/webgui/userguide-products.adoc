= Products 
On the *Products* page you can manage localboot and netboot products and also configure them for different opsi-servers or {opsi-clients}. 

image::opsi-webgui_products.png[Products]

TIP: Navigate to *Clients* and click theimage:opsi-webgui_buttonproducts.png[Products]button in the top right corner of the table header for a split view of clients and products. 
This allows the user to multitask like selecting clients and managing their products more easily.

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-products-state]]
== Product States
If no client is selected, the *Products* page lists the products of the selected server(s). 
If a product has multiple and conflicting values for the currently selected clients/servers, a *<mixed>* status will be displayed in the corresponding field, with more information in the tooltip. 
The different colored icons in each table column indicate the following:

* Installation Status:
[horizontal]
  image:opsi-webgui_productstat_unequal_warning.png[UnknownInstallationStatusOnClients]:: At least one of the selected clients has an image:opsi-webgui_productstat_unknown.png[unknown] installation status.
  image:opsi-webgui_productstat_unequal_success.png[InstalledInstallationStatusOnClients]:: All selected clients have either image:opsi-webgui_productstat_installed.png[installed] or *_not-installed_*/*_none_*/*_null_* status.
* Action Result:
[horizontal]
  image:opsi-webgui_productstat_unequal_danger.png[FailedActionResultOnClients]:: At least one of the selected clients has an image:opsi-webgui_productstat_failed.png[failed] action result.
  image:opsi-webgui_productstat_unequal_success.png[SuccessfulActionResultOnClients]:: All selected clients have either image:opsi-webgui_productstat_successful.png[successful] or *_none_*/*_null_* action result. 
* Product Version: If multiple servers and clients are selected, you can click the tooltip to view the installed version for the clients.
  - Client related:
[horizontal]
    image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_clientoutdated.png[OutdatedProductVersionOnClients]:: At least one of the selected clients has an outdated product from its server.
  - Server related: 
[horizontal]
    image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_server_equal.png[EqualProductVersionOnServers]:: All selected servers has the same product version.
    image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_server_unequal.png[UnequalProductVersionOnServers]:: The selected servers have different versions of the product.
    image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_server_star.png[NoProductOnSomeServers]:: Not every selected server has this product.

Note that the above multi-valued columns can be sorted. It is sorted in the following or reverse order:

[horizontal]
InstallationStatus:: _installed_ - _unknown_ - _none/not_installed_
ActionResult:: _successful_ - _failed_ - _none_
ProductVersion:: _outdated on clients and unequal on servers_ - _outdated on clients and not on every servers_ - _outdated on clients_ - _unqual on some servers_
// client_outdated _and_ unequal_on_servers, client_outdated _and_ not_on_every_server, client_outdated, unequal_on_servers - not_on_every_server

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-products-dependencies]]
==  Product Dependencies
The dependencies list the products that the selected product requires in order to work. 
It also defines the order of installation between these products.
Depending on the product, there are several requirement types, such as

[horizontal]
_required_:: The main product requires the dependent product, but the installation order is not important/specified.
_pre-required_:: The dependent product must be installed before the main product.
_post-required_:: The dependent product must be installed after the main product.

To view dependencies, 

. Click onimage:opsi-webgui_buttonconfig.png[Config Button]in the product row.
. Select the *[Dependencies]* tab.

image::opsi-webgui_productdependency.png[Product Dependencies]

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-products-properties]]
== Product Properties
The product properties show the server's default values when no clients are selected.
By default, each client has the property values from its server.
If at least one client is selected, you will see its server's default values or a client-specific value that has overridden its server value.

To update product properties,

. Navigate to *Products* page.
. Select clients from clients group.
. Click onimage:opsi-webgui_buttonconfig.png[Config Button]in the required product's row.
. Select the *[Property-Configuration]* tab.
. Update properties by clicking the Boolean Properties check box or selecting one or more options from the Unicode Properties dropdown. 
The options in the dropdown can be filtered by keyword. 
If the properties are editable, the keyword entered in the filter box can be added as an option by clicking the *[Add]* button or pressing *Enter*. 
The newly entered option is saved only when selected.

When you update properties, the changes affect only the selected clients, not their servers. 


include::common:partial$webgui.adoc[tags=warn_quicksave]

[horizontal]
Description:: The product description is displayed above the tabs.
Warnings:: Some of the warnings are,
* _No clients are selected, the changes will be applied to the server_.
* _This product is only installed on 2/5 of the currently selected servers._
* _Different versions exists for this product._
image:opsi-webgui_buttoninfo.png[Info]:: in the property id, displays more details about the property, including the default value defined for the product, the default value of the server and the description of the property.
<mixed>::  If the selected clients have different values, the status *_<mixed>_* is displayed. 
image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_clientunequal.png[UnequalPropOnClients]:: Click this icon to the right of the value dropdown to see the different values for the selected clients.

If the selected servers have the product with different versions, it is possible that they have different properties or different default values. 
Similar to the product version, it is marked with icons, such as +

[horizontal]
image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_server_unequal.png[UnequalDefaultPropsOnServers]:: The selected servers have different default values for this product.
image:opsi-webgui_productstat_version_server_star.png[UnequalPropertyOnServers]:: Not every server from the current selection has this property.

[[opsi-manual-opsiwebgui-products-groups]]
== Product Groups
Products can be added to groups for better management and also for easier installation of multiple products. 

To view groups,

. Navigate to the *Products* page.
. In the table header, click Product Group tree component.

image::opsi-webgui_productgroups.png[Product Groups]

Currently it is not possible to add a product to a group in {opsi-webgui}, but if groups are already defined in your environment (e.g. via {opsi-configed}), you can select the groups. 
This selects all products within the group. 
This makes it easier to install via the *ActionRequest* dropdown in the table column header.

TIP: After the group selection, sort the products table by `selections` to get a detailed view.
