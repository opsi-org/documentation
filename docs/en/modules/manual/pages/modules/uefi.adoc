[[opsi-manual-uefi]]
= opsi mit UEFI/GPT

Today's computers usually ship with UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). This firmware interface is the BIOS successor (Basic Input/Output System) and offers more flexibility and improved performance: UEFI supports 64-bit processors and, thanks to GPT (GUID Partition Table), hard disks with more than 2{nbsp}TByte storage capacity. GPT is the successor to MBR (Master Boot Record) and theoretically allows unlimited partitions on a single hard disk ( all operating systems should support 128 partitions).

UEFI can often be switched to the so-called legacy mode (i.e. the old start-up mode). This makes it possible to install older operating systems or software that are not compatible with UEFI. However, there are an increasing number of devices that do not offer legacy mode (UEFI-only). These cannot be managed in opsi environments via PXE boot. To integrate such computers as well and to be able to use the advantages of UEFI, we have developed this extension. It allows BIOS and UEFI clients to be managed side by side.

TIP: A list of netboot products with UEFI support and Secureboot support can be found at the end of this chapter.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-whatisuefi]]
== What is different with UEFI?

UEFI is considerably more powerful than the conventional BIOS. Basically, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface is a little mini-operating system of its own. Without going into great detail, here are some points that are of particular importance for the system administrator:

* UEFI and classic BIOS sometimes coexist -- sometimes one of them can be disabled, sometimes not. Sometimes UEFI is implemented with CSM (Compatibility Support Module), sometimes without. Netboot works or doesn't work -- of course, this is particularly important when it comes to client management systems.

* In the classic BIOS, BIOS and operating system settings are (usually) separate. This means that the boot order is also fixed and cannot be changed by the operating system. With UEFI it is different: the operating system can change the boot order (and usually makes use of it). This also affects the netboot connection of the computers to the client management system.

* UEFI contains its own boot manager with the boot entries of the operating systems. Operating systems can change the order of the entries (see above). This simplifies a coexistence of different operating systems on the device because the boot loaders no longer overwrite each other.

* UEFI is implemented in 32 or 64{nbsp}bit. This then also specifies the architectur of the operating system, i.e. a 32{nbsp}bit OS cannot be installed on a 64{nbsp}bit UEFI (and vice versa).

* xref:modules/secureboot#opsi-manual-secureboot[Secureboot] is a UEFI feature which ensures that booting Windows only works if certain firmware elements (e.g. the boot loader) have not been modified by third parties. Secureboot is enabled by default since Windows 8.

* Partitioning with GPT and additional partitions for the boot loaders:

** 1st partition: EFI System Partition (ESP) 100 to 260{nbsp}MB; VFAT
** 2nd partition: Microsoft Reserved Partiion (MSR) 32 to 128{nbsp}MB; NTFS
** Starting from here are the actual OS partitions

[[opsi-manual-uefi-whatisgpt]]
== What is different with GPT?

GPT (GUID Partition Table) replaces the previous MBR partition tables. GPT is part of the UEFI specification.

Key features for the system administrator are:

* No 2{nbsp}TB limit (now 8{nbsp}zebibytes or 9.6{nbsp}zettabytes, i.e. 9,600 million terabytes).

* Theoretically any number of partitions (128 should be supported by all OS; no distinction between primary, extended and logical partitions)

* Changed partition types (GUIDs)

* New: Partition GUIDs

* New: Partition attributes (read-only, hidden, etc.)

* Other tools for editing: `gdisk`.

In general, GPT can be used without UEFI. But UEFI only works with GPT. If UEFI is used, then one or two additional partitions are added:

. EFI System Partition, ESP (here are the bootloaders)

. Microsoft Reserved Partition, MSR

[[opsi-manual-uefi-preconditions]]
== Prerequisites

NOTE: This module is currently a https://www.uib.de/de/opsi-erweiterungen/erweiterungen[paid extension]. This means that you need an activation file to unlock it. You will receive this file after you have purchased the extension. For evaluation purposes, weâ€™re happy to provide you with a temporary license free of charge. Please contact us via mailto:info@uib.de[email].

More details can be found in xref:modules/modules#opsi-manual-modules[opsi Extensions].

The extension requires opsi 4.1 or newer. The following table lists the required opsi packages:

.Required Packages
[options="header"]
|==========================
|opsi Package|Version
|Netboot products|>=4.1
|opsi server |>=4.1
|`opsipxeconfd` |>=4.1.1.20-3
|`opsi-linux-bootimage`|>=20200506
|==========================

[[opsi-manual-uefi-weitere-hinweise]]
== General Requirements

opsi 4.0.5 only supports 64{nbsp}bit UEFI installations.

For installation via PXE boot (Preboot eXecution Environment), you need a UEFI-capable WinPE_UEFI (a Windows PE version specifically designed to boot on systems with UEFI firmware). Often Windows PE (Windows Preinstallation Environment) already contains UEFI support (check if there is a folder `EFI` and a file `winpe/bootmgr.efi` of the opsi netboot product). Otherwise, use DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) to create an up-to-date Windows PE (see section xref:modules/common/partials/firststeps-osinstall_win.adoc#firststeps-osinstall-fill-base-packages-nt6-pe-manual[Manual PE Creation]). A UEFI WinPE is expected in the `winpe_uefi` folder of the opsi netboot product.

TIP: If there is a Windows PE for both boot modes, you can replace `winpe_uefi` with a symbolic link to `winpe`.

You have to configure an external DHCP server to enable PXE boot via the opsi server. Enter `linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed` as the boot file.

In the management interface {opsi-configed} activate the checkbox  _UEFI-Boot_ for UEFI clients (since version 4.0.5.8.1). Alternatively, configure the host parameter `clientconfig.dhcpd.filename` for the clients and enter the boot file there:

[source,prompt]
----
clientconfig.dhcpd.filename=linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed
----

You can also change the setting using the following command:

[source,prompt]
----
opsi-admin -d method configState_create "clientconfig.dhcpd.filename" "<Host-ID>" "linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed"
----

CAUTION: If your opsi server had earlier package versions installed, you may need to modify the `/etc/opsi/opsipxeconfd.conf` file to ensure compatibility between the UEFI bootloader and the named pipe.

Change this line

[source,prompt]
----
uefi netboot config template x64 = /tftpboot/linux/pxelinux.cfg/install-elilo-x64
----

so that it reads:

[source,prompt]
----
uefi netboot config template x64 = /tftpboot/linux/pxelinux.cfg/install-grub-x64
----

=== BIOS Settings

The menus of the different BIOS versions use different terms and names. If in doubt, choose the setting that is suitable for your computer:

* Disable Secureboot: The setting is often found in the _Boot_ or _Startup_ section, sometimes under _Security_. For more information, see the xref:modules/secureboot#opsi-manual-secureboot[Secureboot Support] chapter.

* BIOS in UEFI mode: If you have the choice between _UEFI only_, _Legacy only_ or _Both_, select _UEFI only_. If the computer is set to _Both_, and this cannot be switched off, the extension may still work. If the entry _Legacy Support_ is present, disable it. _CSM Support_ in connection with _UEFI only_ can remain activated, if you have no other choice.  _UEFI Network Boot_ has to be enabled; the option may also be called _Network Stack_ in the _UEFI_ section. If you have the option to configure IPv4 and IPv6 separately, _IPv4_ is the correct choice.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-opsiuefinetboot]]
== opsi Support for UEFI/Netboot

Our extension enables the connection of clients via UEFI/netboot. It is planned to continuously develop this module over the next few years. The extension includes the following components:

* Customization of the netbootable UEFI bootloader GRUB2 for opsi and the client management needs respectively

* new `opsipxeconfd`, which provides configuration files for the opsi-GRUB2 in addition to configuration files for the previous PXE boot

* providing new (64{nbsp}bit) opsi Linux bootimages with tools for UEFI and GPT management

* Conversion of all netboot products for OS installation (Windows/Linux) with support for UEFI/GPT (except operating systems which do not have UEFI support themselves)

* Store the setting if the opsi server should treat a client as UEFI client +.
(`clientconfig.dhcpd.filename=linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed`)

* support for software-controlled switching to UEFI netboot

As far as the firmware interface allows it (i.e. if a netboot entry in the BIOS can be activated), the opsi server stores the UEFI netboot label of the client (as `clientconfig.uefinetbootlabel`). This allows opsi products to change the boot order to netboot for the next reboot. This technique is implemented in several opsi products, for example in `opsi-uefi-netboot`. It tries to switch to netboot and then trigger a reboot. If no UEFI netboot label is found or if it is not a UEFI computer, only a reboot is triggered. This product works on Windows and Linux.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-install]]
== Installation

All packages required are installed automatically with opsi version 4.0.5.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-dhcpd]]
== DHCP Server Configuration

To boot UEFI clients via PXE, you need a corresponding entry in the boot file:

[source,prompt]
----
clientconfig.dhcpd.filename=linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed
----

Since both variants are probably present in the opsi environment, the DHCP server must assign the correct boot file on the opsi server to the clients. The next two sections show configuration examples for a DHCP server on Linux and on Windows.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-dhcpd-linux]]
=== Example: Configuration on Linux (ISC DHCP Server)

The configuration of the DHCP server is located in the file `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. This is how to set up a switch in this file:

----
filename "linux/pxelinux.0";

# this is the UEFI detection:
if substring (option vendor-class-identifier , 19,1 ) = "0" {
        log (info, "pxe client");
        filename "linux/pxelinux.0";
}
else if substring (option vendor-class-identifier , 19,1 ) = "6" {
        log (info, "efi32 client");
        filename "linux/pxelinux.cfg/elilo-x86.efi";
}
else if substring (option vendor-class-identifier , 19,1 ) = "7" {
        log (info, "efi64 client");
        filename "linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed";
}
else {
        log (info, concat ( "Unhandled vendor class Arch: ", substring (option
        vendor-class-identifier , 19,1 )));
}
----

TIP: The Univention forum has a guide on how to set up a DHCP switch on Univention Corporate Server:
https://help.univention.com/t/how-to-configure-a-dhcp-switch-for-uefi-and-non-uefi-boot/9931

[[opsi-manual-uefi-dhcpd-winsrv]]
=== Example: Configuration on Windows Server 2012 R2

Enter the boot file for UEFI 64{nbsp}bit as default. To do this, adjust the DHCP options 66 and 67 as follows:

* _066 Host name of the start server_: IP address of the opsi server.

* _067 Name of the start file_: `linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed`.

To distinguish the clients, define a manufacturer class identifier on the DHCP server:

----
  Define manufacturer class
  Add new manufacturer class
  Edit class
    Display name: Legacy BIOS
    Asci: PXEClient:Arch:00000:UNDI:002001

----

Map the predefined options to the manufacturer class:

----
  Set predefined options
  Options
    Option class: Legacy BIOS
    Add
  Adjust the option type
    Name: Legacy BIOS
    Data Type: String
    Code: 60
    Description: PXEClient Class Legacy BIOS
  Predefined options and values
    String: PXEClient
----

Define a DHCP policy that maps the boot file for PXE boot (BIOS) to the manufacturer class:

----
  New policy
    Policy Name: PXE BootFile Legacy BIOS
    continue
  Add conditions
    Criteria: Manufacturer class
    Operator: equals
    Value: Legacy BIOS
    add
  Would you like to configure an IP address range for the following policy: No
  Manufacturer class: DHCP Standard Options
    067 Name of the start file
    file input
      String value: linux/pxelinux.0
----

There are two entries in the range options for the star file, which in one case is linked to a policy to detect BIOS clients:

----
067 Name of the Start file: linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed	Policy: None
067 Name of the Start file: linux/pxelinux.0	   Policy: PXE BootFile Legacy BIOS
----

[[opsi-manual-uefi-opsipxeconfd-config]]
== `opsipxeconfd` Configuration

Starting with version 4.0.7.7 it is possible to customize the path of the files used as template via the configuration file `opsipxeconfd.conf`. To do this, specify the paths with `uefi netboot config template x86` or `uefi netboot config template x64`.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-goodbios]]
== Criteria for a "good" BIOS

Whether a UEFI BIOS meets the requirements of a client management system like opsi depends on various criteria.

NOTE: These criteria say nothing about the quality of the hardware -- rather, it's about how well it can be managed by using netboot.

The following table shows a few sample comparisons:

.Example: Differences between UEFI and BIOS

image:unsupported.png[width=15]: Unsupported
image:develop.png[width=15]: Under Development
image:discontinued.png[width=15]: Discontinued

"Entry can be activated" means in this context that netboot can be activated via the standard software for the next reboot, "Netboot without interaction" means that an activated netboot entry is executed at reboot and no user interaction (e.g. pressing keyboard shortcuts, [F12], etc.) is necessary for this. Only if these preconditions are  met, certain opsi products can trigger a netboot. This feature is very important for automated processing. A product in which this is implemented is the localboot product `opsi-uefi-netboot` for Windows and Linux.

[[opsi-manual-uefi-technical-gpt]]

GPT uses "new" partition types which are based on the previously known ones. For example, the partition type `07` (for NTFS) becomes `0700` under GPT. Correspondingly, the two Linux partition types `82` and `83` are called `8200` and `8300`. To display the list of known partition types, you can enter the following command:

NOTE: In fact, the partition types listed here are only "abbreviations" for the actual GUIDs used (which gave the partitioning scheme its name). For example, `0700` stands for `Microsoft basic data` and for the GUID `EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7`.

`0700` stands for `Microsoft basic data` and for the GUID `EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7`

You can find a complete list of all GUIDs in Wikipedia, for example:

* https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Partitionstyp-GUIDs

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table#Partition_type_GUIDs

The tools `gdisk` and `sgdisk` use an internal table to substitute unknown partition types. For example, for the "old" partition type for VFAT32 `0b` there is no equivalent of the form `0b00`. But if you pass `0b00` as type to `sgdisk`, the tool translates it to `0700` -- probably along the lines of "VFAT32, this will probably be an MS data partition..."

GPT partitions support attributes. The next table shows a list of currently known attributes:

To set the attributes, use `sgdisk -A` (`--attributes`) on Linux and the `diskpart` program with the `gpt attributes` command on Windows.

Examples:

[source,prompt]
----
sgdisk -t 1:0700 --attributes 1:clear:63 --attributes 1:set:62 -p /dev/sda
----

[source,prompt]
----
select disk 0
select partition 1
gpt attributes=0x0000000000000000
----

To display the partition table with `sgdisk`, use the `-p` parameter (`--print`):

[source,prompt]
----
sgdisk -p /dev/sda
----

You can get detailed info about a partition (`1`) with `--info=`:

[source,prompt]
----
sgdisk --info=1 /dev/sda
