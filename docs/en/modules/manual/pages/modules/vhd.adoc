[[opsi-manual-vhd-preconditions]]
== Requirements for the opsi extension 'opsi vhd reset'

This module is currently a
link:https://www.opsi.org/product/extensions-of-opsi/[cofunding project]. +
It is bundled with the extension 'opsi-local-image' (see <<opsi-manual-localimage>>) - that means: the activation for 'opsi-local-image' also applies to 'opsi-vhd-reset'. +
Some conditions have to be met to use this module. This means that you need an activation file to use it. You will receive this activation if you buy the extension. For evaluation purposes, we also provide a time-limited activation free of charge (-> mail to info@uib.de). +


Further details can be found in xref:modules/modules.adoc#opsi-manual-modules[opsi Extensions].

As a technical requirement opsi >= 4.0.7 is required with the package versions:

[[opsi-manual-vhd-introduction]]
== Introduction

To use computers in training rooms within a short time, e.g. to put them back into a defined state during a break between two courses requires special techniques. With 'opsi-local-image' opsi already offers a solution, that is now supplemented by a new method that has specific advantages and disadvantages.

. Initial Windows 10 installation in a VHD container.
. 'Sealing' the initial installation by using a 'child' VHD.
. Quick restore by replacing the 'child' VHD.
. Upgrade of the initial installation by a merge of the 'child' VHD.
. This method works with snapshot techniques known from virtualization without using virtualization itself.

== Process steps

[[opsi-manual-vhd-proceedings-initial]]
=== Initial Installation

Windows 10 is installed in a VHD container using the product `opsi-vhd-win10-x64`.

.Scheme: Initial Installation 1: Creation of the VHD
image::opsi-vhd-inst1.png["Scheme: Initial installation with opsi-vhd-win10-x64", width=400]

.Scheme: Initial Installation 2: Windows Installation
image::opsi-vhd-inst2.png["Scheme: Initial installation with opsi-vhd-win10-x64", width=400]

The desired applications can then be installed on this Windows.

.Scheme: Initial Installation 3: Software Installation
image::opsi-vhd-inst3.png["Scheme: Initial installation with opsi-vhd-win10-x64", width=400]

By executing the opsi product 'opsi-vhd-control', the current opsi metadata for this client (which product is installed in which version) is stored in the initial installation. +
The Windows PE is then activated and booted for the further process. +
The product opsi-vhd-control has a very low priority (-97) and therefore only runs after the installation of application software. As a result, the opsi-vhd-control product can be set to 'setup' together with the application software.

.Scheme: Initial Installation 4: Activating the PE partition
image::opsi-vhd-inst4.png["Scheme: Initial installation with opsi-vhd-win10-x64", width=450]

After the Windows-PE boots, the second part of 'opsi-vhd-control' starts to work and creates a child VHD which seals the initial installation and records all further changes.

.Scheme: opsi-vhd-control: Sealing the initial installation
image::opsi-vhd-control-1stsnap.png["Schema: Sealing the inital installation  with opsi-vhd-control", width=400]

All changes from now are stored in the 'child' VHD.

[[opsi-manual-vhd-proceedings-restore]]
=== Fast recovery

The initial installation can be restored using the opsi product 'opsi-vhd-control'. +
First, the saved opsi metadata is restored from the system.
Then for handling of the Child VHD the system boots into Windows PE again.

.Scheme: opsi-vhd-control: Recovery of the initial installation 1
image::opsi-vhd-control-activatepe.png["Scheme: Recovery of the inital installation with opsi-vhd-control 1", width=400]

The 'child' VHD with the changes is deleted in Windows PE and replaced with a new, empty 'child' VHD.

[[opsi-manual-vhd-proceedings-update]]
=== Updating an image using `opsi-auto-update`

To update the initial installation with patches and software updates, you can proceed as follows:

* Restore the initial installation (as described above)
* Install the updates
* Integration of the updates in the initial installation and re-sealing by starting 'opsi-vhd-control' with the property 'upgrade=true'
* This also stores the new opsi metadata in the system

These processes are carried out automatically by the product `opsi-auto-update`.

The product `opsi-auto-update` replaces the previous product `opsi-vhd-auto-upgrade`


[[opsi-manual-vhd-components]]
== The opsi-vhd products

The extension 'opsi-vhd-reset' consists of the following products:

The netboot product for the initial installation:

* `opsi-vhd-win10-x64`

The localboot product to control the creation, the replacement and merge of the child VHDs:

* `opsi-vhd-control`

The localboot product to control the fully automatic upgrade of the parent VHD.

* `opsi-auto-update`

[[opsi-manual-vhd-components-uefi]]
=== UEFI Compatibility

The opsi-vhd products are UEFI compatible.


[[opsi-manual-vhd-components-netboot]]
=== The opsi netboot product 'opsi-vhd-win10-x64' and its properties

This netboot product is very similar to the normal netboot products (4.1.0) for Windows installations and must be filled accordingly as described in the 'getting-started' manual. +
Also the properties are mostly the same.

The following properties are special for this product:

* `windows_vhd_size` +
This property specifies the size of the base VHD absolute or as a percentage of the harddisk size, minus the WinPE partition. The default value of 100% is automatically reduced to 80% to leave room for the child VHD. If (absolute or relative) a value is entered that would exceed 80%, this is also reduced to 80%. +
This property replaces the standard property 'windows_partition_size' +
(Default = 100%)

* `installto`: +
This value is 'vhd' and should not be changed.

The following properties are not existing for this product:

* `windows_partition_size`, `windows_partition_label` +
See above. The label of the partition on which the VHDs are located is 'CONTAINER'.
* `data_partition_size`, `data_partition_letter`, `data_partition_create`, `data_partition_preserve` +
Currently the usage of a data partition is not possible with opsi-vhd.
* `boot_partition_size`, `boot_partition_letter`, `boot_partition_label` +
Currently the usage of a boot partition is not possible with opsi-vhd.
* `pre_format_system_partitions`, `preserve_winpe_partition` +
With opsi-vhd these two values are always 'true'.

[[opsi-manual-vhd-components-control]]
=== The opsi localboot product 'opsi-vhd-control' and its properties

The opsi-vhd-control product has a very low priority (-96).

* `disabled` +
This property is for debugging purposes. +
If 'true', the product does not execute any actions. +
Default = 'false'

* `upgrade` +
If 'true': Merge the changes that are collected in the child VHD to the parent VHD.
Then replace the child VHD with an empty one. +
If 'false': replace the child VHD with an empty child VHD. +
At the end of a successful 'upgrade' run, this property is automatically reset to 'false'. +
Default = 'false'

* `stop_on_no_network_in_pe` +
This property is for debugging purposes. +
If 'true': Abort with an error message, to analyze why no network connection could be established.
Default = 'false'

[[opsi-manual-vhd-components-upgrade]]
=== The opsi localboot product 'opsi-auto-update' and its properties

opsi-auto-update is a product to simplify the maintenance of the clients.

In essence, this product can be used to ensure that the installed products are up to date. +
The product sets all installed products,
whose version is not identical to that on the server,
for the client to setup. +
Since this product can not only be used in the context of 'opsi-vhd-reset', it is described in the chapter 'opsi standard products' / 'opsi-auto-update': +
xref:products/localboot-products#opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-auto-update[opsi-auto-update]

[[opsi-manual-vhd-restrictions]]
=== Known Problems and Restrictions

* There is also a 32 bit version. Due to a problem with the diskpart merge command, this can only be used to a limited extent in the 32 bit Windows PE versions.

* In theory, an implementation for Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 Enterprise would be possible. We will only build these products at request. 

* There are indications that a Windows 10 release upgrade of an installation in a VHD will fail. +
