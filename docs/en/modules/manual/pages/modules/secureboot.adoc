[[opsi-manual-secureboot]]
= opsi with Secure Boot

OEM manufacturers deliver an additional layer of security with secure boot (sometimes written as _secureboot_).
With secure boot only authorized Software and operating systems can be installed on a machine.
This authorization is implemented directly via a key query to the UEFI.
As long as the used keys match the operating system and software the usage will be authorized.
The key inside the UEFI capable machines was created by Microsoft and the OEM manufacturer.
Therefore any loaded efi binary or kernel has to be signed off by one of those keys.
A _chain of trust_ verifies that every loaded efi binary or kernel has a correct signature.

This module currently is a
link:https://www.opsi.org/product/extensions-of-opsi/[co-funded opsi extension]. +
Some preconditions are required to work with that module, should be dully noted that a suitable modules file is needed to unlock the feature, and also the prerequired module.
You can get this unlocked modules file by purchasing the extension.
For evaluation purposes we can provide you with an evaluation modules file free of charge. (-> mail to info@uib.de). +

[[opsi-manual-secureboot-notes]]
== Further remarks for the usage of the secure boot module

Secure boot is only possible on clients that support this feature as part of their firmware.
The installation of a client with secure boot is only supported on 64-bits.

UEFI Netboot installs require a winpe that is capable of booting in UEFI mode.
Often, an existing winpe will be capable of booting in such way, to verify it check if there is a folder named `EFI`, as well as a file named `bootmgr.efi` inside your winpe folder.
If that is not the case, create a UEFI compatible winpe as explained in our opsi-getting-started Manual, Chapter "Creating a PE".
The winpe, that is UEFI capable, needs to be located in the winpe_uefi folder of the opsi netboot product.
If your winpe is already capable of booting UEFI and MBR modes, you could simply place a softlink `winpe_uefi` > `winpe`.

[[opsi-manual-secureboot-server-configuration]]
== opsi server configuration for secure boot clients

If you have an external DHCP server you have to configure it so it forwards an UEFI Netboot to your {opsi-Server}.
The bootfile has to be: `linux/pxelinux.cfg/shimx64.efi.signed`

Activate the "Uefi-Boot" checkbox in the {opsi-configed} for uefi clients.
Alternatively you can run the following command:

[source,prompt]
----
opsi-admin method configState_create "clientconfig.dhcpd.filename" "<insert host id here>" "linux/pxelinux.cfg/elilo.efi"
----

CAUTION: Using the file `elilo.efi` via the opsi-admin command only serves the purpose to set the UEFI checkbox within the opsi-configed.
This has no relation to the usage of the dhcp bootfile.
The opsi-configed will feature a secure boot checkbox and accept the proper filename in a future release.

In addition the UEFI template for UEFI clients has to be changed in the xref:server/important-files.adoc#opsi-manual-important-files-etc-opsi-opsipxeconfd[configuration file of the opsipxeconfd].
The specific `uefi netboot config template x64` must have the value `/tftpboot/linux/pxelinux.cfg/install-grub-x64`.
We recommend to run the 'opsi-setup --init-current-config' command after this change.

All UEFI clients will boot the Microsoft signed file _shimx64.efi.signed_ which is provided by the _opsi-linux-bootimage_ package.
Clients with activated secure boot verify the signature and load the grub2 bootloader file.
Non secure boot clients fail this verification and also load the grub2 bootloader.
Either way both type of clients load the _shimx64.efi.signed_ file.
The installation itself doesn't differ in secure boot and non secure boot mode.
Clients successfully installed in secure boot mode can be checked with the command `msinfo32`.
The output contains an entry _secureboot_.

[[opsi-manual-secureboot-client-configuration]]
== Client configuration

NOTE: Please keep in mind that terms might change depending on manufacturer and hardware model,

The UEFI of the client should be configured as following:

* secure boot enabled +
This entry is most commonly found in the section 'Boot', 'Startup' of 'Security'.

* Run the BIOS in UEFI mode. +
If you have a choice between 'UEFI only', 'Legacy only' and 'Both' choose 'UEFI only'
Deactivate 'Legacy Support' as Secure Boot only works on a 'UEFI only' setup.
'CSM Support' in combination with 'UEFI only' can be left activated.
In case of doubt deactivate the 'CSM Support' feature.
'UEFI Network Boot' needs to be activated.
This entry can also be called 'UEFI Network Stack'.
If your machines UEFI gives you a distinction between 'IPv4' and 'IPv6', 'IPv4' is the choice to make.
