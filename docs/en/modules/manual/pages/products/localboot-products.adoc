[[opsi-manual-localboot-products]]
= Localboot products: automatic software distribution with opsi

Localboot products are all products that are installed by the '{opsi-client-agent}' after the computer started the installed OS. This is in contrast to the netboot products described below xref:products/netboot-products.adoc#opsi-manual-netboot-products[Netboot products].


[[opsi-manual-localboot-standardprodukte]]
== opsi standard products

The following localboot products are part of the default installation of opsi.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-client-agent]]
=== '{opsi-client-agent}'

The '{opsi-client-agent}' is the client agent of opsi and is described in detail above: see chapter xref:client/opsi-client-agent#opsi-manual-clientagent[opsi-client-agent].

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-script]]
=== '{opsi-script}'

The product '{opsi-script}' is a special case. It contains the current '{opsi-script}'.
This does not have to be set to setup to update. Rather, part of the '{opsi-client-agent}' checks each time it is started whether a different version of the '{opsi-script}' is available and fetches it if this is the case.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-javavm]]
=== javavm: Java Runtime Environment

The product javavm provides the Java Runtime Environment for the clients, which is required for '{opsi-configed}'.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-configed]]

[[opsi-manual-localboot-swaudit_hwaudit]]
=== swaudit + hwaudit: Products for hard- and software-audit

The hwaudit and swaudit products are used for hardware and software inventory.
The hardware data is collected via WMI and reported back to the server via the '{opsi-webservice}'.
For the software inventory the information is taken from the registry key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall)and reported back to the server via the '{opsi-webservice}'.

=== opsi-logviewer

Text viewer with selection for log levels and events. +
For Windows and Linux.

* The opsi-logviewer tool created by uib now also opens files that are compressed in the archive formats zip or gzip.
This means that log files that are sent as an archive can be viewed directly. (If an archive contains several files, the contents are of all files are appended.)

* The setup script has been expanded to include Linux support so that opsi-logviewer can also be installed automatically on a Linux client.

* The new before-dependency on javavm ensures the this program can be started (because javavm copies the javaw.exe into the system directory)



[[opsi-manual-localboot-config-win10]]
=== config-win10

Configures various Windows 10 settings such as lock screen, hibernation boot, sending telemetry and update behavior.

Version 4.0.7 added new options.

* *allow_useractivity_publishing* allows Microsoft to collect userctivity experiences

* *change_power_plan* changes the power management profile.

* *config_updates* allows you to change the source of the updates. The updates are then downloaded either directly from Microsoft servers, a local peer-to-peer network or a peer-to-peer network from the Internet. The 'disable' option is meanwhile moved into a separate property called 'disable_updates'.

* *defer_upgrade* postpones updates and upgrades. Updates can be postponed by four weeks and upgrades by eight months. It should be noted that security-relevant updates are installed despite the 'defer' option. However, feature updates are not installed.

* *deferfeatureupdatesperiodindays* Defines how long quality updates, also called windows upgrades, should be defered. The maximum is 365 days.

* *deferqualityupdatesperiodindays* Defines how many days feature updates should be defered. The maximum is 29 days.

* *disable_advertising_id* deactivates the so-called Advertising ID. This stores data about the browser history in order to display user-specific advertising.

* *disable_app_suggestion_in_startmenu* deactivates suggested apps in the start menu.

* *disable_automatic_logon_on_reboot*: disables an automatic logon after reboot.

* *disable_cortana* deactivates the Cortana voice assistant. This collects various data about input and transfers this data to Microsoft servers.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-auto-update]]
=== opsi-auto-update

opsi-auto-update is a product to simplify the maintenance of the clients.

WARNING: opsi-auto-update is not for clients running the WAN-extension

In essence, this product can be used to ensure that the installed products are up to date. +
The product sets all installed products,
whose version is not identical to that on the server,
for the client to setup.

Properties for managing exceptions:

* name: `products_to_exclude`
** description: (Blacklist) Which opsi product(s) should be excluded from update ? +
List of products that should not be installed even if there is an update (such as windomain)

* name: `products_to_exclude_by_regex`
** description: (Blacklist) Which opsi product(s) should be excluded from update (by regular expressions)? +
List of regular expressions that fit products that should not be installed even if there is an update (such as windomain)

* name: `products_to_include`
** description: (Whitelist) Which opsi product(s) should be checked for update ? ; If empty = all products +
Here you can enter a list of products to which the update check should be limited. Products that are not in this list are also not considered when checking for updates. Exception: If the list is empty, all products are checked.



Properties for managing includes:

* name: `products_to_run_always`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should be installed via every update ? (List will not be cleared after run) +
List of products which are set to setup every time opsi-auto-update is run.

* name: `failed_products_to_setup`
** description: if true this also sets all failed products to setup on all clients +
If this is True, all products currently on failed are set to setup.

Properties for sequence control:

* name: `shutdown_on_finish`
** description: if true we have a final shutdown
if false we have no reboot / shutdown
default: False +
Should a shutdown me made after the product has finished?

////
* name: `setup_after_install`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should we switch to setup after update is done ? +
List of products which are set to setup after each run of opsi-auto-update. (e.g. shutdownwanted)
////

Special properties for 'local-image / vhd-reset': +
See also: xref:modules/vhd.adoc#opsi-manual-vhd[opsi vhd reset] +
See also: xref:modules/local-image.adoc#opsi-manual-localimage[opsi local image] +

* name: `do_cleanup`
** description: If false: skip restore before update +
This property is ignored if it is not a vhd or local image installation. +
For a vhd installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-vhd-control` before the updates, thereby discarding all changes and restoring the saved state. +
For a local-image installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-local-image-restore` before the updates, thereby discarding all changes and restoring the saved state. +
In both cases, information about action requests is also discarded. In order to be able to add or remove products during a run of `opsi-auto-update`, there are the following two properties.


* name: `products_to_install`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should be installed via update ? (List will be cleared after run) +
List of products which are set to setup during the opsi-auto-update run. If the products have been installed successfully, they will be removed from this list.

* name: `products_to_uninstall`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should be uninstalled via update ? (List will be cleared after run) +
List of products which are set to uninstall during the opsi-auto-update run. If the products have been uninstalled successfully, they will be removed from this list.

* name: `do_merge`
** description: If false: skip backup after update +
This property is ignored if it is not a vhd or local image installation. +
For a vhd installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-vhd-control` with `upgrade=true` after the updates and thus all changes are saved. +
For a local-image installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-local-image-backup` after the updates and thus all changes are saved.

Properties for debugging: +

* name: `disabled` +
This property is for debugging purposes. +
If 'true', the product does not execute any actions. +
Default = 'false'

* name: `rebootflag` +
Please do not change during the run. This should be '0' before starting.

* name: `stop_after_step` +
This property is for debugging purposes. +
If not '0' then this is the number of reboots after which to stop.
Default = '0'

The `opsi-auto-update` product has a very low priority (-97),
which is even less than that of opsi-vhd-control.

The `opsi-auto-update` product can be combined well with a cron job that executes `opsi-wakeup-clients`. +
(opsi-wakeup-clients is part of the opsi-utils package) +
For details see here: xref:server/temporal-job-control#opsi-manual-temporal-job-control-cron-opsi-auto-update[opsi-wakeup-clients, opsi-auto-update and working_window]

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order]]
== Manipulating the installation sequence by priorities and dependencies

Since opsi 4.0, the installation order is determined by the {opsi-server} taking into account product dependencies and product priorities.

* Product dependencies +
Defines dependencies and the necessary installation order between opsi-packages. A typical example is the dependency of Java programs on the Java Runtime Environment (javavm).

* Product priorities +
Priorities are used to push certain packages forward or backward in the order of installation. It makes sense to install service packs and patches first and a software inventory at the end of an installation sequence. +
Product priorities are numbers between 100 and -100 (0 is the default)

There are different possibilities how these two factors are used to determine the installation order. Therefore, opsi provides two algorithms.

Switch between these algorithms can be done either:

using '{opsi-configed}', in the server configuration

.'{opsi-configed}': server configuration
image::configed_serverconfiguration_en.png["opsi-configed: server configuration", pdfwidth=90%]

or on the command line with the following command:
[source, shell]
----
opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults
----

.Choose the sort algorithm: Part 1
image::opsi-setup-product_sort_algorithm.png["Choose the sort algorithm: Part 1", pdfwidth=80%]

.Choose the sort algorithm: Part 2
image::opsi-setup-product_sort_algorithm2.png["Choose the sort algorithm: Part 2", pdfwidth=80%]

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-algorithm1]]
=== Algorithm1: product dependency before priority (default)

With this algorithm, the products are first sorted based on their priorities and then re-sorted based on the product dependencies. This of course allows a product with a very low priority to be pushed far forward because it is required by a product other than 'required before'. On the other hand, it prevents installation problems due to unresolved product dependencies. +
Algorithm 1 ensures that the installation order is constant, regardless of how many products are set to setup. This order corresponds to the order which is shown in configed when the products are sorted according to the position column. +
This ensures that if a setup script is only interrupted with "ExitWindows /immediateReboot", the processing of the interrupted script is continued immediately after the reboot.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-algorithm2]]
=== Algorithm2: product priority before dependency

This algorithm is based on the idea that in practice, there are essentially three priority classes:

* Products to be installed first such as OS patches and drivers that bring the PC to a standard state. Is realized by assigning a high priority (maximum +100).

* "Normal" products that install applications (default priority 0).

* Products that should be installed last, e.g. software inventory control. Realized by assigning a low priority (lowest possible -100).

Product dependencies are only resolved within a priority class. This ensures that products with a high priority are actually installed at the beginning. Cross-priority product dependencies are not taken into account or give a warning. It is therefore important to note when packaging that product dependencies are only defined within one priority class.

The product dependencies are interpreted here in such a way that with "normal" products they automatically lead to a consistent order that takes all dependencies into account. If contradictory (circular) dependencies have been defined, an error is displayed.

In the case of products with high priorities that are essential for setup of the computer, however, the administrator should set the exact order by hand - similar to, for example, Unix start-up scripts - by assigning a specific priority between +100 and +1 for each product according to the desired order. The same applies to the final products with low priorities.



[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-create]]
=== Defining product priorities and dependencies

Priorities and product dependencies belong to the metadata of an {opsi-product}. You will be asked for these when creating a product with the command `opsi-newprod`.

This metadata is stored in the control file of the product and can be edited there. After a change in the control file, the product must be repacked and installed again.

See also the chapter 'Creating an opsi product package' in the opsi-getting-started manual.
