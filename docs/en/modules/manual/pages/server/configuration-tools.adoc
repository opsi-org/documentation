[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli]]
== _opsi-cli_

opsi has received some command line tools and opsi-python scripts over time. Among them are `opsi-setup` or `opsi-admin` and others. Since not all command line tools were created at the same time, each has its own parameter handling and different outputs. Many of these components use the standard RPC interface for backend operations, while many bypass the opsi web service and operate directly on the backend. The new opsi-cli aims to provide all this and much more. At the same time with opsi-cli a new plugin system was implemented, which allows opsi users to extend the functionality of opsi-cli by own plugins. In the following it is described how the new 'opsi-cli' can be used.

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-installation]]
=== _opsi-cli_ Installation

`opsi-cli` is officially installed with the opsi-utils package on the opsi servers. Thus a manual installation is not necessary. `opsi-cli` can be used as a client component also outside the opsi server, the communication takes place exclusively via the opsi web service. Therefore `opsi-cli` is also available for Linux, Windows and MacOS.

INFO: To use the `opsi-cli` outside of the {opsi-server} you have to pass access data to the opsi-webservice. One possibility is to use the options `--service`, `--username`, `--password` or to store the credentials locally on the client (see `opsi-cli config service add --help`).

`opsi-cli` is a directly executable binary and can be used portably. If you want to install the binary on a client in the path, `opsi-cli` can be used itself for that:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli self --help
----

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-usage]]
=== _opsi-cli_ usage

`opsi-cli` is a Python binary which is controlled by commands. Similar to docker or kubectl, each command can contain one or more subcommands. In the following, first the basic functionalities and then the already available `commands` are presented. At each point of the call there is the possibility to display a help message, for example: `opsi-cli --help` or `opsi-cli config --help`.

The general call to opsi-cli looks like this:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
----

The options immediately following the `opsi-cli` call itself are considered global configuration and apply to all subcommands as well. There are three main categories in global options.

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-globaloptions]]
==== Global options

In diesem Segment lässt sich der allgemeine Ablauf und das Logverhalten beeinflussen.

image::opsi-cli-general-options.png["Output: opsi-cli general options", pdfwidth=90%]

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-formatoptions]]
==== Output options

With opsi-cli the output of all subcommands can be unified and offers various formats and filter options.

image::opsi-cli-io-options.png["Output: opsi-cli io options", pdfwidth=90%]

Here is another example how the output can be influenced:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"id":"client*.domain.local"}'
----

[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Created by opsi-deploy-client-agent at Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:19:29",
    "id": "client-linux.domain.local",
    "hardwareAddress": "08:00:27:f5:1d:8e",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.56.11",
    "inventoryNumber": "",
    "systemUUID": null,
    "opsiHostKey": null,
    "created": "2022-09-26 17:19:29",
    "lastSeen": "2023-03-08 12:13:10",
    "oneTimePassword": null,
    "type": "OpsiClient",
    "ident": "client-linux.domain.local"
  },
  ...
]
----

The same call with different formats and filtered to three attributes:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli --output-format table --attributes id,type,lastSeen jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"id":"client*.domain.local"}'
----

image::opsi-cli-table-format.png["Tableformat", pdfwidth=70%]

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli --output-format csv --attributes id,type,lastSeen jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"id":"testclient0*.uib.local"}'
...
id;lastSeen;type
client-linux.domain.local;2023-03-08 12:13:10;OpsiClient
client-macos.domain.local;2023-03-15 14:55:37;OpsiClient
client-win10.domain.local;2023-03-15 15:13:46;OpsiClient
----

The `--output-file` option can also be used to write the output directly to a file.

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-serviceoptions]]
==== Service options

If used outside the opsi server, credentials for the opsi web service must be used. With the following options you can pass the credentials directly when calling the service (alternatively you can store the credentials locally on the client. For more information about this alternative: `opsi-cli config service add --help`). You can also store different service configurations as profiles if you want to manage more than one opsi system.

image::opsi-cli-service-options.png["Output: opsi-cli service options", pdfwidth=90%]

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands]]
=== Kommandos

The currently available commands are explained below.

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands-config]]
==== config

This command can be used to change the `opsi-cli` configuration:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli config --help
----

image::opsi-cli-config-help.png["Output: opsi-cli config --help", pdfwidth=90%]

The following command can be used to display the current configuration and its default settings:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli config list
----

image::opsi-cli-config-list.png["Output: opsi-cli config list", pdfwidth=90%]

To persistently set a value, you can use the command `opsi-cli config set <name> <value>`. This value will then be active for all subsequent calls of `opsi-cli`. To remove the value, use `opsi-cli config unset <name>`. To manage access data to opsi service, there is `opsi-cli config service` with the subcommands `add`, `list` and `remove`.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands-jsonrpc]]
==== jsonrpc

With this cammand you get direct access to the opsi webservice API. So `opsi-cli` is a complete drop-in replacement for `opsi-admin`. jsonrpc has two subcommands. With `opsi-cli jsonrpc methods` you get a list of all available API methods and parameters. This list also shows if the method is marked as "deprecated" and in this case also gives an alternative method as recommended fallback. These methods also appear in the log. However, experience has shown that these messages are not noticed in practice. That gives direct access to the current status. The second subcommand `execute` executes the API method. The syntax for the call itself is very similar to the usage with `opsi-admin`.

The following is a direct comparison:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute authenticated
----

Legacy Call:

[source,bash]
----
{opsi-admin} method authenticated
----

The method parameters are passed absolutely identically. Here is a more complicated example for clarification:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects '["created","lastSeen"]' '{"id":"testclient01.uib.local"}'
----

Legacy Call:
[source,bash]
----
{opsi-admin} method host_getObjects '["created","lastSeen"]' '{"id":"testclient01.uib.local"}'
----

In the examples the option -d of {opsi-admin} was deliberately omitted. Bypassing the opsi webservice has caused problems within the opsi system in the past. Therefore the way to the API is now only possible via the opsi webservice and `opsi-cli` does not support this mode at all. On an opsi server directly you don't need any credentials, these are read out automatically from the server configuration. Because everything is done via the opsi webservice, you can manage opsi from everywhere. To use `opsi-cli` in scripts or cronjobs outside of the opsi server you have to store the credentials before.

Also here the output formats can be influenced like everywhere with `opsi-cli`:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli --output-format table --attributes id,created,lastSeen jsonrpc execute host_getObjects '["created","lastSeen"]' '{"id":"testclient01.uib.local"}'
----

If you use this on windows, be aware that it might be necessary to use escape sequences, as cmd and powershell interpret single and double quotes in a different way. The following example shows the distinguishing behaviour (The command shows information about all opsi depots in the environment).

unix shell:
[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"type":"OpsiDepotserver"}'
----

cmd:
[source,cmd]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] {\"type\":\"OpsiDepotserver\"}
----

powershell (until version 7):
[source,powershell]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{\"type\":\"OpsiDepotserver\"}'
----


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands-client-actions]]
==== client-action

The command `client-action` gives the possibility to manage the opsi clients. `client-action` itself offers primarily options to influence the list of clients on which the actions affect:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli client-action --help
----

image::opsi-cli-client-action-help.png["Output: opsi-cli client-action --help", pdfwidth=90%]

Currently this command supports another subcommand `set-action-request`, which sets product actions for clients. It is comparable with the tasks of opsi-admin, but works according to an exclusion principle. That means without explicit specification and filtering of clients and products the action affects everything. Below this subcommand there are further options to filter the products on which the action has an effect:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --help
----

image::opsi-cli-set-action-request-help.png["Output: opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --help", pdfwidth=90%]

Here are some examples:

WARNING: When called without explicitly specifying clients and products, the command affects all clients and all products. To prevent errors, opsi-cli does not allow set-action-request to be executed without at least one of `--where-outdated`, `--where-failed`, `--products`, `--product-groups`.

To set all obsolete products to `setup` for all clients:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --where-outdated
----

To set a specific product to `setup` for a client:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --clients test-98.domain.tld set-action-request --products {opsi-client-agent}

[5] [2022-10-28 12:54:59.998] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-98.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:55:00.055] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:55:00.065] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: {opsi-client-agent} -> test-98.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

The product state `setup` is the default if you want to set the same package to uninstall:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --clients test-98.domain.tld set-action-request --products {opsi-client-agent} --request-type uninstall

[5] [2022-10-28 12:57:06.848] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-98.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:57:06.904] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:57:06.914] [               ] Setting 'uninstall' ProductActionRequest: {opsi-client-agent} -> test-98.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

To reset an action request for a client for a specific product the switch `None` is used (`none` is also accepted):

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --clients test-98.domain.tld set-action-request --products {opsi-client-agent} --request-type None

[5] [2022-10-28 14:12:50.538] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-98.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 14:12:50.574] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 14:12:50.580] [               ] Setting 'None' ProductActionRequest: {opsi-client-agent} -> test-98.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

In the event that an error is found in a product, all product actions on clients should be temporarily rolled back to prevent the faulty product from being distributed further:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --products {opsi-client-agent} --request-type None
----

If the product is available again without errors, all outdated or faulty product statuses can be set back to setup:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --where-outdated --where-failed
----

To set a specific product to setup for a client group:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --client-groups testclients set-action-request --products {opsi-client-agent}

[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.100] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-1.domain.tld', 'test-2.domain.tld', 'test-3.domain.tld', 'test-4.domain.tld', 'test-5.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)

When processing `--where-outdated` and `--where-failed`, there is a list of packages that are automatically excluded. These packages are "opsi-winst", "opsi-auto-update","opsi-script", "shutdownwanted", "windows10-upgrade", "activate-win", "opsi-script-test", "opsi-bootimage-local", "opsi-uefi-netboot", "opsi-wan-config-on", "opsi-wan-config-off", "opsi-winpe", "win10-sysprep-app-update-blocker", "windomain". It is possible to exclude additional products or product groups. An even safer way is to maintain a product group and explicitely limit the handled products to that group.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands-plugin]]
==== plugin

The `plugin` command is used to manage the plugins. All commands in `opsi-cli` are included as plugins, this also applies to the command `plugin` itself. It is possible to install new plugins from outside the system, but also to extract running plugins from the system.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli plugin --help
----

image::opsi-cli-plugin-help.png["Output: opsi-cli plugin --help", pdfwidth=90%]

To generate a template for a new plugin, you can use

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli plugin new
----

After supplying a name, version and description, a new directory with that name is created in the current working directory. Contained are directories `python` and `data`.
`python` represents a python-package and can be filled with the code for the new plugin. Entrypoint is in `__init__.py`, which is already filled with a command, a subcommand and some options as an  example. `data` contains static ressources for the plugin and can be ignored in most cases.

After the template has been filled with content, the code can be registered as a plugin to the local `opsi-cli` instance.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli plugin add <directory>
----

If <directory> contains valid python code, the contained command is then available as plugin in `opsi-cli` (`opsi-cli plugin list` shows all registered plugins).
A plugin can be exported to an archive, which can be imported at another `opsi-cli` instance (`opsi-cli plugin add <archive>`).

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli plugin export <name>
----

Archive and directory representation of a plugin can be converted into the other using `opsi-cli plugin compress <directory>` and `opsi-cli plugin extract <archive>`.

To change an imported plugin, you can adapt the directory representation (as created with `opsi-cli plugin new`) and call `opsi-cli plugin add <directory>` again. This overwrites the previously added plugin with the same name.

You can remove a plugin from an `opsi-cli` instance using:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli plugin remove <name>
----


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands-self]]
==== self

The command `self` is used to manage the `opsi-cli` instance itself. With it you can install and uninstall `opsi-cli`, setup the shell autocompletion and display the command structure.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli self --help
----

image::opsi-cli-self-help.png["Output: opsi-cli self --help", pdfwidth=90%]

Starting from a `opsi-cli` binary, you can install `opsi-cli` using the call `opsi-cli self install`. That means the binary is copied to a path, where it is globally accessable (for windows the path is added to PATH environment to achive that). Additionally a config file is created to store persistent configurations. Installation can be done user specific or system wide (option `--system`). For uninstallation use `opsi-cli self uninstall`.

TIP: During installation of the `opsi-cli` opsi package on a client or the `opsi-utils` server package the installation is performed automatically.

The whole command structure with all commands (and their versions) and subcommands can be printed with this command:

[source,shell]
----
# opsi-cli self command-structure

┃   ┣━━ uninstall
┃   ┗━━ command-structure
┣━━ support (0.1.0)
┃   ┗━━ health-check
┗━━ terminal (0.1.1)
----

`opsi-cli` offers the possibility to set up autocompletion for shells. The call is:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli self setup-shell-completion
----

After restarting the currently active shell, you can use the TAB-key to trigger different support mechanisms:

* show list of available (sub-)commands (use TAB TAB)
* show list of available options (following `-`)
* complete the started (sub-)command, option oder parameter (if unique)

These support mechanisms can speed up working with `opsi-cli`.

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-cli-commands-support]]
==== support

The command `opsi-cli support` offers ways for analysing and solving problems in an opsi environment. At the moment there is only one subcommand. `opsi-cli support health-check` checks different aspects that may threaten smooth operation of an opsi environment and assembles a report.
The following example shows a compact representation of the report. Without the filter (`--attributes=id,status,message`) additional information is displayed regarding the warnings and errors.

[source,shell]

==== terminal

The command `opsi-cli terminal` is a minimal terminal client which can be used to open a connection to opsi servers. The behaviour is similar to a ssh/Putty console.
You can use the fqdn (opsi host id) of an opsi server to contact or use the placeholder `configserver` to reach the config server.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-cli terminal {configserver}
----

The connection is closed when the terminal on the destination is closed. This can be done by `exit<Enter>` or the keyboard shortcut `STRG+D`.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-setup]]
== Tool: _opsi-setup_

This program is something of a 'Swiss army knife' for configuration. Opsi installation scripts use opsi-setup as well as various other common maintenance and repair tasks.

Some common opsi-setup tasks include:

* Depot server registration
* File access rights correction
* Backend data storage initialization
* Backend upgrades (from 3.4 to 4.0)
* MySQL backend configuration
* Default configuration editing
* Backend cleanup
* Essential Samba share configuration
* Essential DHCP configuration

The `opsi-setup --help` command switch displays the following options:

----

Additional functions and switch options:

* `--ip-address <ip>` +
Set the ip-address for '{opsi-server}' and don't resolve by name.

* `--register-depot` +
This option is used to register an '{opsi-server}' as depot on a '{opsi-configserver}'.
For details see:

////
<<opsi-manual-multidepot-installation>>.
////

* `--set-rights [path]` +
Sets file access rights on all opsi directories:
+
** `/tftpboot/linux`
** `/var/log/opsi`
** `/var/lib/opsi`
** `/var/lib/opsi/depot`
** `/var/lib/opsi/workbench` (or a different depot path)
** `/etc/opsi`

+
You may state a path as argument to limit access rights of this specific directory. +
For example: +
`opsi-setup --set-rights /var/lib/opsi/depot/winxppro/drivers`

* `--init-current-config` +
initialize the configured backend. This command should always be used after changing the configuration file. +
`/etc/opsi/backendManager/dispatch.conf`

* Commands: +
`--update-mysql` +
`--update-file` +
 are used to upgrade the backends from one opsi version to the next one. +
For details see the 'releasenotes-upgrade-manual'.

* `--configure-mysql` +
Configures the MySQL database for the first time. +
////
See <<opsi-manual-backends-mysql-initializing>>.
////

* `--file-to-mysql` +
Automatically migrates an environment with file backend enabled to a MySQL backend.
Before the migration a backup is created automatically and the opsi services are stopped. After the migration, the services are started again and then automatically use the MySQL backend.

The following parameters can be used here:

``--no-backup``: Do not create a backup. +
``--no-restart``: Do not stop or start services.

The call returns the following exit codes: +.
**0**: Migration done successfully. +
**1**: An error occurred during migration. +
**2**: Migration has already been performed. +

* `--edit-config-defaults` +
Edits '{opsi-configed}' default values.
+

image::opsi-setup_editconfigdefaults.png["Dialog: opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults", pdfwidth=90%]
+
For example:
+
clientconfig.depot.id :: Configures the name of the default depot server.
+
clientconfig.depot.drive :: Configures a drive letter to mount the installation data share. You can either select a specific drive letter or choose the *dynamic* option. With the *dynamic* option enabled, the client will try to automatically select a drive letter from those not in use.
+
license-management.use :: Defines if netboot products should get license keys from license management or from the product properties.
+
product_sort_algorithm :: Defines the algorithm used to calculate the product installation sequence.

* `--cleanup-backend` +
Checks the current backends for integrity and removes obsolete or unreferenced entries. +
Examples for entries that may be removed are products without reference (not installed on depot / client), host-groups without a parent and configstates without configuration. +

NOTE: Backup your backend configuration with 'opsi-backup' as standard best practice.

* `--auto-configure-samba` +
Creates opsi share entries in the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` configuration file.

* `--auto-configure-dhcpd` +
Creates needed DHCP daemon configuration file entries. +
Don't use this option if you don't plan to use dhcpd on the opsi server. +

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-makepackage]]
== Tool: 'opsi-makepackage': build opsi-packages

Use `opsi-makepackage` to build a opsi package from the opsi product files. The simpelst way is: +
 Change to the root directory of the product (maybe `/var/lib/opsi/workbench/myproduct/`, and enter `opsi-makepackage`. The product package will be built.  The package (`<package name>`) will be a file that has a format similar to `/var/lib/opsi/workbench/<myproduct>/<myproduct_ProductVersion-PackageVersion>.opsi`.

`opsi-makepackage` can be started with different options:

                        Set new package version
  --product-version productversion
                        Set new product version for package
----

It is recommended to create the packages with a corresponding md5 checksum file.
This file is used amongst others by `opsi-package-updater` to check after a file transfer to ensure package integrity.
This file is created by default but its creation can be suppressed for special purposes.

When transferring packages to {opsi-depotserver} zsync can be used to only transfer differences between different packages.
To be able to use this method a special `.zsync` file is required.
This file is created by default but its creation can be suppressed for special purposes.

If you are running into the problem that the creation of a package fails because of insufficient free space in `/tmp` you can use the option `--temp-directory` to specify a different temporary folder.

If there is already a package file with the same version information, opsi-makepackage will ask for overwrite confirmation:

[source,shell]
----
Package file '/var/lib/opsi/workbench/mytest/mytest_3.14-1.opsi' already exists.
Press <O> to overwrite, <C> to abort or <N> to specify a new version:
----
Choosing `o` will overwrite, `c` abort, and 'n' will ask for new version information.

The created opsi-package can be installed at the {opsi-server} with the command: +
`opsi-package-manager --install <packagefile>`


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-package-manager]]
== Tool: 'opsi-package-manager': (un-)install opsi-packages

The `opsi-package-manager` is used for (un-)installing {opsi-product-packages} on an opsi-server.

To install an {opsi-product-package}, the opsi system user {opsiconfd} must be able to read the package. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to install those packages at `/var/lib/opsi/workbench` (or other subdirectory).

The 'opsi-package-managers' log file path is `/var/log/opsi/package.log`.

Silent package install (install without prompts):

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi'
----

Install a package (with prompts after each property):

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -p ask -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

Reinstall a package (package reinstall for everyone who has it installed):

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -S -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

Reinstall a package (package reinstallation with dependencies):

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -s -i softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

Or:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager --setup-with-dependencies --install softprod_1.0-5.opsi
----

Silent package uninstall (uninstall without prompts):

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -r softprod
----

Extract and rename a package:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager -x opsi-template_<version>.opsi --new-product-id myprod
----

You may install a package with a different 'product id'. Helpful when a custom Windows netboot product derives from an existing package, and such package updated in the meantime.

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-manager --install win7-x64_1.2.3.opsi --new-product-id win7-x64-custom
----

NOTE: Please note that products installed in such a way will not be automatically updated by `opsi-package-updater`.

Running `opsi-package-manager` with the `--help` switch lists all possible options.

Please note:

* Multi-depot-server environments use the `-d` or `--depots` option exclusively.

* The `-d` option copies the opsi-package to the target servers `/var/lib/opsi/repository` directory before installing. Please make sure that there's enough free space on the target server file system. See also: xref:modules/multidepot.adoc#opsi-manual-multidepot[multidepot]

* If package installation fails due to lack of free space on your target’s temporary folder, you can specify a different temporary folder with the `--temp-dir` option.

There are some common options.

- `--verbose` increases the visible output volume and is re-adjustable, as needed. You can specify log level with the `--log-level` switch. Both options only affect the output in terminal.

- `--repo <name of a repository>` limits the actions of the given repository. The `list --active-repos` option lists available repositories.

Different modes result in different behavior.
The `install`, `update` and `download` modes load packages from a repository, whereas `list` displays information.

`install` mode installs new packages.
`update` mode overhauls installed packages to a newer version.
Both modes don't require other parameters.

Example: Installing all available packages on all repositories:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-updater install
----

The modes `install` and `update` limit the actions to specific products by using their ID.


Example: Updating the packages for the products 'firefox' and 'javavm':

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-updater -vv update firefox javavm
----

You can specify the package source with `--repo id`.

Example: Installing 'ubuntu' package from the 'uib_linux' repository:

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-updater -vv --repo uib_linux install ubuntu
opsi-package-updater install
----

The `download` mode allows to download packages without installing them afterwards.
The `--force` switch forces the download of a package, even if this version is already installed on the server.
The modes `install` and `update` allow to limit the actions to specific products by handing over their ID.

Example: Updating the packages for the products 'firefox' and 'javavm':

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-updater -vv update firefox javavm
----

In combination with the `--repo` switch the package source can be limited.

Example: Installing the package for 'ubuntu' from the repository 'uib_linux':

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-updater -vv --repo uib_linux install ubuntu
----

The mode `download` allows to download packages without installing them afterwards.
The switch `--force` forces the download of a package even though this version is already installed on the server.

Through `list --active-repos` the active repositories are shown.
The information consists of name, address and if applicable the description of the repository.

You can display active repositories using `list --active-repos`.

The information displayed is name, address, and, if available, the repository description.

Through `list --products` the available products per repository are shown.

To display possible updates use `list --updatable-products`.
This option only considers product already installed.
Finally, the update can begin using `update`.

`list --products` displays available products
`list --updatable-products` displays available updates.

Installed products are only considered using the aforementioned command.
Product update is kicked off via update.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-updater list --updatable-packages
opsi-package-updater -v update

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-package-updater-repositories]]
=== Repository Configuration: Access

Repository configurations are specified in `/etc/opsi/package-updater.repos.d/`.
You will find a commented template with all possible configuration options in file  `example.repo.template`.

There are two kinds of repositories - 'internet' and 'opsi-server' repositories.

*Internet Repositories*

Example: download.uib.de +
You configure this repositories by:

- 'baseURL' (for example http://download.uib.de)
- 'dirs' (a list of directories for example: opsi4.0/products/essential)
- and for password protected repositories 'username' and 'password'
- an alternative to password protected repositories, is certificate authentication if the repository supports it. For this, you need to configure 'authcertfile' and 'authkeyfile' with the full path to the clientcertificate and keyfile.
- If a HTTPS baseURL is used and the server signature should be verified, you need to set 'verifyCert' to 'true'. At the moment the default is 'false'.

You can configure access through proxy, if required. To use a common proxy for all repositories, specify it at the `opsi-package-updater.conf` file. This file requires at least opsi-utils 4.1.1.33. All repositories without their own proxy use this configuration.

[source,configfile]
----
baseUrl = http://download.uib.de
dirs = opsi4.0/products/localboot
username =
password =
proxy =
----

*opsi-server*

A repository has the 'opsi-server' type, if the configured ID points to another opsi-server. You can specify such ID in the repository configuration file, under the item `opsiDepotId`.

[source,configfile]
----
opsiDepotId = mainserver.my.lan
----

You can set the central '{configserver}'on an '{opsi-depotserver}'. As a result, `opsi-package-updater` will fetch packages from the `/var/lib/opsi/repository` directory of such central server.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-package-updater-actions]]
=== Repository Configuration: Behavior

For each repository you have to configure which actions to run:

* 'autoupdate': Newer versions of installed packages will be downloaded and updated

* 'autoinstall': Packages not yet installed will be downloaded and installed

* 'autosetup': Clients using this product are set to 'setup', on the action request column, once all new packages are downloaded and installed on the server.

* 'onlyDownload': Opsi downloads new packages, but no further actions take place.

* 'ignoreErrors': Tries to continue downloading/updating even after errors occured when processing any package.

Administrators use this option together with notifications, to trigger a notification email. This way, the administrator can install the packages at a convenient time in the future.

In addition, you can send all these clients a Wake-On-LAN signal to install the new software. Furthermore, {opsi-product} 'shutdownwanted' ensures that clients power off after the installation.

* time window for autosetup: You can specify a time window which may be used to change the client action requests to setup.

* Automatic WakeOnLan with shutdown: If there's new software, Clients could be woken up and shutdown after installation automatically.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-admin-overview]]
== Tools for opsi API access: {opsi-admin} & opsi interface page

opsi has a python library which provides an API for opsi configuration.
Documentation for this API regarding python-opsi link:https://docs.opsi.org/python-docs/python-opsi[https://docs.opsi.org/python-docs/python-opsi]
and opsicommon link:https://docs.opsi.org/python-docs/python-opsi-common[https://docs.opsi.org/python-docs/python-opsi-common] is at docs.opsi.org.

The 'opsiconfd' provides this API as a web service that can be accessed in multiple ways.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-interface-page]]
=== In the browser: opsi admin page

Versions 4.2 _interface_ and _info page_ merged into the new _admin page_.
Point your browser to 'https://<opsi-server>:4447/admin' to access.
You must access with 'opsiadmin' group credentials.

The first _Blocked Clients_ tab displays a list of all blocked clients. Clicking the _unblock_ button releases this client. You can unblock clients individually by IP or unblock all clients en masse.

With _Delete client sessions_ you can delete all client sessions.

The user receives feedback in a text box under the input fields. The server's JSON response is also output.

.'opsiconfd': Blocked Clients
image::opsi-webinterface-blocked-clients.png["opsiconfd: Blocked Clients", pdfwidth=90%]


The *RPC-Info* tab contains a table of the last RPC calls. Click the header bar to sort the table.


.'opsiconfd': RPC list
image::opsi-webinterface-rpc-list.png["opsiconfd: RPC list", pdfwidth=90%]


The *RPC-Interface* tab contains the former _interface page_. With the interface you can make API calls. The request and the response is displayed as JSON.

.'opsiconfd': RPC interface
image::opsi-webinterface-rpc-interface.png["opsiconfd: RPC interface", pdfwidth=90%]

You can use the *Redis interface* to make redis calls. The response from the server is displayed in JSON.

.'opsiconfd': Redis interface
image::opsi-webinterface-redis.png["opsiconfd: Redis-Interface", pdfwidth=90%]

// [[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-serverprocesses-info]]
// === 'opsiconfd' monitoring: grafana

The tab *Grafana* redirects the user to the Grafana dashboard of the opsiconfd. There you can find
information about the load history of the 'opsiconfd'.

.opsiconfd info: {opsiconfd} values from the last 3 hours
image::opsiconfd-grafana-hour.png["opsiconfd info: {opsiconfd} values from the last 3 hours", pdfwidth=90%]

.opsiconfd info: {opsiconfd} values from the last day
image::opsiconfd-grafana-day.png["opsiconfd info: {opsiconfd} values from the last day", pdfwidth=90%]

If the Grafana server is running on the same host as the 'opsiconfd' and no user and password have been set with the configuration variable `grafana_internal_url`, a new Grafana user is created in the database and the variable `grafana_internal_url` is adjusted (example: http://opsiconfd:passwort@<host>:3000). The creation of the user takes place when starting 'opsiconfd' or calling `opsiconfd setup`. Grafana can be called via the admin page (https://<opsi-server>:4447/admin). Clicking on the appropriate tab will redirect to https://<opsi-server>:4447/metrics/grafana/dashboard. The endpoint 'metrics/grafana/dashboard' creates and opens the dashboard in Grafana. On redirection the 'opsidashboard' user is created if he does not exist. The opsidashbord user is used for the automatic login in Grafana and gets a random password on each call.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-admin]]
=== On the commandline: {opsi-admin}

At the command line 'opsi-admin' provides an interface to the opsi API.
There's an interactive mode and a non-interactive mode for batch processing from within scripts.

The `opsi-admin --help` switch displays a list of available command line options:
[source,shell]
----
$ {opsi-admin} --help

Usage: {opsi-admin} [options] [command] [args...]
Options:
  -h, --help           Display this text
  -V, --version        Show version and exit
  -u, --username       Username (default: current user)
  -p, --password       Password (default: prompt for password)
  -a, --address        URL of {opsiconfd} (default: https://localhost:4447/rpc)
      --opsirc         Path to the opsirc file to use (default: ~/.opsi.org/opsirc)
                       An opsirc file contains login credentials to the web API.
  -d, --direct         Do not use {opsiconfd}
      --no-depot       Do not use depotserver backend
  -l, --log-level      Set log level (default: 3)
                       0=nothing, 1=essential, 2=critical, 3=error, 4=warning
                       5=notice, 6=info, 7=debug, 8=debug2, 9=confidential

  -c, --colorize       Colorize output
  -S, --simple-output  Simple output (only for scalars, lists)
  -s, --shell-output   Shell output
  -r, --raw-output     Raw output
  --exit-zero          Always exit with exit code 0.
----

The `opsi-admin` command interacts by way of the opsi web service or first hand with the data backend. To work via the web service, you must specify 'username' and 'password' together with a URL. The `opsi-admin` command defaults to the currently logged-in user but allows you to specify a different username with `--username`.

For security, you want to avoid plain text passwords when using this command in scripts. This prevents unauthorized users from capturing the credential values. Use an <<opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-admin-opsirc,opsirc file>> to secure your credentials or, as an alternative, use the `-d` option for direct data access.

`opsi-admin` includes an interactive mode, the `-i` switch, often used with `-c`, for colored display, and `-d` for direct data access. The full combined command becomes `opsi-admin -i -c -d`, or `opsi-admin -idc` for short.

Interactive mode uses the Tab key for navigation. The tab key allows you to navigate through the multiple choice options or input text fields. Page up and down scroll through the entire screen.

Options `-s` and `-S` generate an output format which scripts can easily parse through.

Besides API-request based method calls, there's a collection of function ‘tasks’ which combine method calls to perform complex or specific jobs.


[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-opsi-admin-opsirc]]
=== Usage of a connectionsettings file - opsirc

Starting on version 4.1.1.30, `opsi-admin` allows you to save web service connection configuration in a file. This allows you to use the web service without retyping your credentials every time you connect from command line.

By default, `opsi-admin` searches for credentials at `~/.opsi.org/opsirc` but you can specify a different path using the `--opsirc` switch, allowing you to maintain various configuration files.

An 'opsirc' file has the following contents:
[source,ini]
----
address = https://seeing.the.ramp:4447/rpc
username = tony
password file = ~/.opsi.org/tonys_secret
----

Everything in an opsirc file is optional. If the file is empty or doesn’t exist, opsi will use the default values.

In the previous example, the `~/.opsi.org/tonys_secret` file keeps the password and opsi in turn, reads this information from the specified path location. This file in turn, contains the password.

Although not recommended, you can state the password in plain text in the opsirc file:
[source,ini]
----
address = https://seeing.the.ramp:4447/rpc
username = tony
password = first900
----

[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-serverprocesses]]
== Server processes: {opsiconfd} and {opsipxeconfd}

'opsipxeconfd' provides the 'named pipes' to control the PXE boot process in the `tftpboot` directories.

The configuration file is `/etc/opsi/opsipxeconfd.conf`

The log file is `/var/log/opsi/opsipxeconfd.log`.

The 'opsiconfd' provides the opsi API as JSON web service and other important tasks. 'opsiconfd' is opsis central service, and allows for communication with all clients.

Since its central for communication, monitoring this process and its load is important. You use the 'opsiconfd' info page as a tool to monitor this service.



[[opsi-manual-configuration-tools-serverprocess-tftpd]]
== Server process: opsi-tftpd-hpa

The opsi-tftpd-hpa is a standard tftpd-hpa, with the expanded ability to handle 'named pipes'.

By default, the opsi-tftpd-hpa runs with its own systemd service.

The service starts with a default or simple verbose parameter. You can modify this parameter to get additional information for troubleshooting or analysis purposes. Enter the following command to change verbosity:

[source,shell]
----
# systemctl edit --full opsi-tftpd-hpa.service
----
Replace the '-v' parameter by '--verbosity 7' and restart the service.
[source,shell]
----
# service opsi-tftpd-hpa restart
----

WARNING: on Debian 8 the edit operation is not available. However there is a workaround:
[source,shell]
----
# cp /lib/systemd/system/opsi-tftpd-hpa.service /etc/systemd/system/opsi-tftpd-hpa.service
# vi /etc/systemd/system/opsi-tftpd-hpa.service
