[[opsi-manual-backends]]
= opsi data storage (backends)

[[opsi-manual-backends-file]]
== file backend

When using the '{file-Backend}' the configuration information is stored in ini-files on the server.

Main features of the backend 'file':

* Current default backend
* The files of this backend are located in `/var/lib/opsi/config`.
* Is implemented on the assumption that the FQDN of the server on which the backend is used corresponds to the FQDN of the {configserver}.

The content and structure of these files is explained in more detail in the xref:server/important-files#opsi-manual-important-files-filebackend[Files of the file backend] chapter.

[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-inventory]]
=== mysql backend for inventory data (overview and data structure)

The hardware and software inventory data are by default stored in text files via the opsi '{file-Backend}'. This form of data storage is less suitable for queries and reports. For this, the data can be stored in a SQL database.

Main features of the backend 'mysql':

* Optional (not the default backend)
* For inventory data free of charge, for use with other data you need a paid activation.
* Finely granulated data structure for data storage and additionally a simplified data model for queries.
* A history function, which logs changes to the inventory data.

Due to the very different nature of the hardware components to be inventoried, the data structure is roughly structured as follows:

* A table 'HOST' describes all known clients and provides a unique 'host_id'.
* There are two tables for each device type:
** 'HARDWARE_DEVICE_ ....' describes the device e.g. Network card type with PCI-identifier
** 'HARDWARE_CONFIG ...' describes configuration of the specific network card e.g. MAC address. The two tables are linked to each other via the 'hardware_id' field.

The situation is similar for the software inventory. Again, the 'Software' table describes the total software found, while the 'Software_Config' table stores the client-specific configuration.

This results in the following list of tables:

[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-configdata-overview]]
=== mysql backend for configuration data (overview)

The '{mysql-Backend}' for configuration data has been available since opsi 4.0.

This module is currently a co-financed opsi extension. This means it is not free to use. +
Further details can be found in xref:modules/modules.adoc#opsi-manual-modules[opsi modules].

The '{mysql backend}' has the advantage of a higher performance, especially with large installations.

Here is an overview of the data structure:

.database schema: configuration data
image::mysql-schema-configdata.png["database schema: configuration data", pdfwidth=90%]


[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-initializing]]
=== Initializing the MySQL-Backend

If the MySQL server is not yet installed, this must first be done by:
[source,prompt]
----
apt-get install mysql-server
----

Then a password must be set for the MySQL-user 'root' user':
[source,prompt]
----
mysqladmin --user=root password linux123
----

CAUTION: Since MySQL-Server version 5.7 the previously optional 'strict mode' is enabled by default. This causes the `opsi-setup --configure-mysql` command to fail. Accordingly, the file `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` should be edited before the command is executed. +
The following line must be inserted in the `[mysqld]` section: +
`sql_mode = NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` +
  +
Then the service `mysql` has to be restarted:` systemctl restart mysql.service` +
It is now possible to continue.

The database can now be set up with the command `opsi-setup --configure-mysql`.

An example session:

.opsi-setup --configure-mysql: Input dialog
image::mysql-config-input-mask.png["Dialog: opsi-setup --configure-mysql", pdfwidth=90%]

.opsi-setup --configure-mysql: Output
image::mysql-config-output.png["Output: opsi-setup --configure-mysql", pdfwidth=90%]

In the input dialog, all entries can be confirmed with Enter except for the password.

Next you have to specify in `/etc/opsi/backendManager/dispatch.conf` that the '{mysql-Backend}' should also be used. A detailed description of this configuration can be found in the 'Backend configuration' chapter of the 'getting-started manual'. The file itself contains a number of examples of typical configurations.
A configuration for the '{mysql-Backend}' (without internal dhcpd) looks like this:
[source,opsifiles]
----
backend_.*         : mysql, opsipxeconfd
host_.*            : mysql, opsipxeconfd
productOnClient_.* : mysql, opsipxeconfd
configState_.*     : mysql, opsipxeconfd
.*                 : mysql
----

After completing the configuration, you must execute the following commands to use the now configured and converted backend:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-setup --init-current-config
opsi-setup --set-rights
systemctl restart opsiconfd.service
systemctl restart opsipxeconfd.service
----

CAUTION: The 'opsiconfd' service has no hard dependency on MySQL by default, since opsi can be used without a MySQL-backend, and the service can also run on another server.
Please refer to the documentation of your operating system on how to configure this.


[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-configuration]]
=== Manual configuration

A manual configuration can be done via the backend configuration file.
By default this is `/etc/opsi/backends/mysql.conf`.

Since python-opsi 4.1.1.76 it has been possible to force the creation of new connections after a certain time in order to avoid problems with timeouts.
One indication of such timeouts can be the message 'mysql server has gone away'.

You can set a timeout by specifying 'connectionPoolRecycling' after how many seconds a new connection should be created.
The default value is `-1`, which means no forced reconnection.
If this value is set, it should generally be lower than the value for connection timeouts configured on the server (link:https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_wait_timeout[wait_timeout]).


[[opsi-manual-backends-mysql-access-config]]
=== Configuration of the MySQL database for external access

The existing database must be configured so that external access is possible, i.e. not only connections from 'localhost' are accepted.

Please refer to the manual of your database for the necessary steps.


[[opsi-manual-backends-hostcontrol]]
== HostControl backend

The HostControl backend does not store any configuration data, but is used to control the opsi clients.
This includes, for example, starting clients via Wake-On-LAN or sending control commands to the opsi-client-agent.

The configuration of the HostControl backend is done in the configuration file `/etc/opsi/backends/hostcontrol.conf`. Configuration options are:

* +opsiclientdPort+: +
Network port for connecting to an {opsi-client-agent}.

* +hostRpcTimeout+: +
Timeout (in seconds) when connecting to an {opsi-client-agent}.

* +resolveHostAddress+: +
If this option is set to +True+, when connecting from {opsi-server} to an {opsi-client}, the IP address of the client is firstly determined via name resolution.
To give preference to the IP address stored in the opsi backend, the option must be set to +False+.

* +maxConnections+: +
Maximum number of simultaneous connections to an {opsi-client-agent}.

* +broadcastAddresses+: +
Assignment of network addresses to broadcast addresses in the form: +.
`{ "<network-address>": { "<broadcast-address>": <port-list> } }` +
Multiple broadcast addresses can be assigned to a network address.
Different ports can be configured for each broadcast address.
The suitable broadcast addresses are determined on basis of the IP address of a client as stored in the opsi backend.
If the IP address is part of several networks, the most specific entry is used. +
Example: +
[source,prompt]
----
"broadcastAddresses": {
		"0.0.0.0/0": {
			"255.255.255.255": [7, 9, 12287]
		},
		"10.10.0.0/16": {
			"10.10.1.255": [12287],
			"10.10.2.255": [12287]
		},
		"10.10.3.0/24": {
			"10.10.3.255": [12287]
		},
		"192.168.1.0/24": {
			"192.168.1.255": [12287, 9, 12287]
		}
	}
----


[[opsi-manual-backends-hostcontrolsafe]]
== HostControlSafe-Backend

A peculiarity of opsi 4.0 methods called without parameters is that it matches all existing objects. For example, the command "host_getObjects" without any parameters returns all host objects. This behavior is somewhat problematic in the HostControl backend. Especially with the two commands: `hostControl_shutdown` and `hostControl_reboot`. In these cases, calling these methods without parameters would shutdown or restart all clients.

Therefore with opsi release 4.0.3 two changes were introduced:

* The methods `hostControl_shutdown` and `hostControl_reboot` are different from the standard opsi 4.0 behavior since this release. These two methods now return an error message when they are called without any parameters.
* A new backend has been introduced (*HostControlSafe*-Backend), which results in error message for all methods, if they are called without any correct client parameter. To explicity address all clients with a HostControlSafe-Backend method, you can use the `*` character:
+
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-admin -d method hostControlSafe_shutdown *
----

For the reasons mentioned above, we recommend using hostControlSafe methods on the console or if you are new to using the service methods.

[[opsi-manual-backends-convert]]
== Conversion between different backends
The `opsi-convert` command is used to convert the opsi configuration data between different backends. Destination and source can be assigned in different ways:

* backend name: +
By specifying the name, a corresponding backend is specified on the current server. The command `opsi-convert file mysql` converts the data on the current server from the '{file-Backend}' to the '{mysql-Backend}'.

* Service address +
By specifying service addresses, a server can can also be addressed remotely. The service address has the form `https://<username>@<ipadresse>:4447/rpc`.
You will be asked for the passwords. +
Example: +
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-convert -s -l /tmp/log https://uib@192.168.2.162:4447/rpc https://opsi@192.168.2.42:4447/rpc
----

`opsi-convert` commandline arguments:

[source,prompt]
----
usage: opsi-convert [-h] [--version] [--quiet] [--verbose]
                    [--log-level {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}] [--clean-destination]
                    [--with-audit-data] [-s OLD SERVER ID]
                    [--log-file LOGFILE]
                    source destination

Convert an opsi database into an other.

positional arguments:
  source                Backend to read data from.
  destination           Backend to write data to.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version, -V         show program's version number and exit
  --quiet, -q           do not show progress
  --verbose, -v         increase verbosity (can be used multiple times)
  --log-level {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
                        Set log-level (0..9)
  --clean-destination, -c
                        clean destination database before writing
  --with-audit-data, -a
                        including software/hardware inventory
  -s OLD SERVER ID      use destination host as new server
  --log-file LOGFILE, -l LOGFILE
                        Log to this file. The loglevel will be DEBUG.

The backends can either be the name of a backend as defined in
/etc/opsi/backends (file, mysql, ...) or the the url of an opsi configuration
service in the form of http(s)://<user>@<host>:<port>/rpc
----

[[opsi-manual-backends-bootfiles]]
== Boot files

`/tftpboot/linux` contains the boot files that are required in conjunction with the PXE network boot.

[[opsi-manual-backends-securing-shares]]
== Securing the shares with encrypted passwords

The '{opsi-client-agent}' accesses the shares made available by the '{opsi-server}' in order to be able to install the software on the client.

The system user 'pcpatch' is used for this. Securing these shares and the authentication data of the pcpatch user are important for:
* General system security and data integrity
* Protection of licensed software packages against misuse

In order to provide the '{opsi-client-agent}' access to the authentication data, a specific key ('{opsi-host-key}') is generated for each client when it is created in opsi. This key is stored (in the '{file-Backend}') in the file `/etc/opsi/pckeys` and is transferred to the PC during reinstallation. The transferred key is stored during the installation of the '{opsi-client-agent}' in the file `c:\program files\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsiclientd\opsiclientd.conf` in such a way that only Administrators have access. Likewise, on the '{opsi-server}' only root and members of the 'opsiadmin' group have access to the file `/etc/opsi/pckeys`. This way, each PC has a key that is only known to the PC and the '{opsi-server}' and which is protected against access by normal users. With this key the current password of the system user 'pcpatch' is encrypted on the '{opsi-server}' and stored in the backend. This encrypted password is read by the client each time the '{opsi-client-agent}' is activated, so that the 'pcpatch' password can be changed at any time and the client is notified of the changed password in an encrypted way.
