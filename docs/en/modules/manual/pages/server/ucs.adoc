= Special notes on UCS 4.X systems

UCS 4.X requires a DHCP policy to enable a PXE boot from a UCS system.
This policy must be made in the domain policy settings for DHCP boot.
For the bootserver option, you enter the server on which the boot file is located. The boot file name is 'pxelinux.0'. Since this file is located directly in the directory `/tftpboot/`, the entry will look like this: 'linux/pxelinux.0'
