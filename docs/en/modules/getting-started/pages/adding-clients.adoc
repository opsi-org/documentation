[[opsi-getting-started-adding-clients]]
== Adding clients to opsi

To be able to manage computers with opsi, they must be known to the opsi system.
In addition, an agent must be running on these computers so that communication between the server and client is possible.
No management is possible without this client agent.

Depending on the environment in which opsi is to be used, there are different procedures.
If there are already clients in the environment with an installed operating system that are to be managed with opsi, they can be integrated in <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration,different ways>>.

The alternative to this is that the computers to be managed by opsi are equipped with a new operating system.
As part of the installation of the operating system, the required agent is also installed by opsi. However, any previously installed software (including the operating system) will be removed.
To use this procedure you first add a <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall-create-client,client to opsi>> and then perform an <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall,OS installation>>.


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall-create-client]]
=== Creation of a new opsi client

To manage computers, they must be known to the {opsi-Server}.
This chapter describes different ways to create a client in opsi for later management.
This is particularly helpful if you want to install an <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall,operating system>> on your computer using opsi.

For the integration of clients with an already installed operating system, please read <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration,the chapter integration of existing Clients>>.


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall-create-client-configed]]
==== Creating a new opsi client via the graphical management interface

A client can be added to the {opsi-Server} through the {opsi-configed} graphical user interface.

From the menu, choose 'OpsiClient / Create new opsi client' and enter:

* Client name
* DNS domain (if different from the default)
* Client description
* IP address (required if DNS can not be used resolve the address of the client)
* MAC address (required if the {opsi-Server} is the DHCP server or if you want to use PXE boot with this client)

After completing the input, the client will be created on the {opsi-Server}, and if the {opsi-Server} is also the DHCP server, the client will also be created in the DHCP configuration, as a PXE client.

The list of configured opsi clients can be viewed at any time in the {opsi-configed} mode "Client configuration" under the 'clients' tab.


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall-create-client-commandline]]
==== Creating a new opsi client via the command line

A client can added through the command line using the tool `opsi-admin`.

The syntax is the following:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-admin -d method host_createOpsiClient <client-id> [opsiHostKey] [description] [notes] [hardwareAddress] [ipAddress] [inventoryNumber] [oneTimePassword] [created] [lastSeen]
----

Missing values usually use a default value - most fields are then empty.


The following command will create the client `testclient.domain.local` with a random host key,
the description `Testclient`, no notes, the MAC address of `00:0c:29:12:34:56` and the IP address `192.0.2.1`:

[source,prompt]
----
opsi-admin -d method host_createOpsiClient testclient.domain.local "null" "Testclient" "" 00:0c:29:12:34:56 192.0.2.1
----


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall-create-client-bootcd]]
==== Creating a new opsi client using the opsi-client-bootcd

On the download page of uib you will find various ISO images of the 'opsi-client-boot-cd' at link:https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/boot-cd/[].
Download the latest and burn it to a CD.

Start the computer from the CD.
You then should see the following screen:

.Start image opsi-client-boot-cd
image::opsi-client-boot-cd.png["Screenshot: Start image opsi-client-boot-cd", pdfwidth=90%]

Choose 'Start opsi (English)'. After a while, the following screen will appear. If your DHCP server assigns IP addresses to unknown DHCP clients, then most fields will already have valid values. Otherwise you have to complete the missing data by hand. You must at least give the hostname.

.bootimage/boot-cd configuration screen
image::boot-cd-config.png["Screenshot: bootimage/boot-cd configuration screen", pdfwidth=90%]

Then choose 'OK'.

.bootimage/boot-cd:  Choose how to create Client
image::boot-cd-select.png["Screenshot: bootimage/boot-cd:  Choose how to create Client", pdfwidth=50%]

Then choose 'Admin account'. This tells the client to register itself at the {opsi-server} using provided credentials.

.bootimage / boot-cd: Authenticate as member of {opsi-admin-group} group
image::boot-cd-authent.png["Screenshot: bootimage / boot-cd: Authenticate as member of {opsi-admin-group} group", pdfwidth=90%]

Now you will get a login window, where you must authenticate yourself as a member of the {opsi-admin-group} group. If this was successful, then the client sends its data to the server, at which point the client will be created at the server. In the next step, the client asks the server for the list of available netboot products, and makes them available for you to choose from.

.bootimage/boot-cd: netboot product list
image::boot-cd-product.png["Screenshot: bootimage/boot-cd: netboot product list", pdfwidth=50%]

Now you may choose the operating system that you would like to install (or e.g. <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall-tests-hwinvent,hwinvent>>).


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration]]
=== Integration of existing Windows clients

To include existing Windows clients in opsi, the {opsi-client-agent} must be installed on them.
This can be realised in several ways. After you have installed the {opsi-client-agent} as described below, the client will also appear in the client list of {opsi-configed}, unless you have already added the client there.

[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup]]
Basically there is the possibility to install the agent <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup,on the client>> or <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,to start the installation from the server>>.

Executing the installation directly on the client is suitable for individual computers.
For a mass rollout of the agent, have a look at <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,opsi-deploy-client-agent>>.
If there is already another way to distribute software available, then it is also possible to distribute the opsi-client-agent through it and execute the script `silent_setup.cmd` included in the package.

Once the agent is installed, available opsi products can be <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests,installed>> on these clients.


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup_nt6]]
==== Using service_setup.cmd on Windows NT6

. Logon to the Windows client with administrative privileges.
. Mount the share `\\<opsiserver>\opsi_depot` on a drive letter.
. On the drive from the previous step, start the script `opsi-client-agent\service_setup.cmd` +
Do not start the script elevated (via right mouse click: 'as Administrator') because an elevated script has no access to the network share.
. The script copies the needed files to a temporary local directory and starts from there the opsi-script (winst32.exe) elevated in order to do the installation. This may cause an UAC Message at this point.
. The script connects to the server via the opsi webservice in order to create the client on the serverside and to retrieve the pckey. This is tried first with the user and password provided in config.ini. If the connection fails, a login window will appear, with the Service-URL ({opsi-configserver}), and user and password. The user required here needs to be a member of the group 'opsiadmin'. It is also possible to use a user which only has rights to call the method `host_createOpsiClient`.

CAUTION: After installation the client reboots without notice.


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup_nt5]]
==== Using service_setup_NT5.cmd on Windows NT5

. Logon to the Windows client with administrative privileges.
. Mount the share `\\<opsiserver>\opsi_depot` on a drive letter.
. On the drive from the previous step, start the script `opsi-client-agent\service_setup_NT5.cmd`
. The script copies the needed files to a temporary local directory and starts from there the opsi-script (winst32.exe) in order to do the installation.
. The script connects to the server via the opsi webservice in order to create the client on the serverside and to retrieve the pckey. This is tried first with the user and password provided in config.ini. If the connection fails, a login window will appear, with the Service-URL ({opsi-configserver}), and user and password. The user required here needs to be a member of the group 'opsiadmin'.

WARNING: After installation the client reboots without notice.


[[opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy]]
==== Using opsi-deploy-client-agent

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script installs the {opsi-client-agent} directly from the {opsi-server} on the clients. This makes it easy to integrate a large number of clients from a server into an opsi environment.

Requirements for the clients are:

* an open C$ share
* an open admin$ share
* an administrative account
* `winexe` must not be blocked by an antivirus program.

The program `winexe` must be available on the server.
This is part of the `opsi-windows-support` package.

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script can be found at `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent` +
Execute the script with 'root' privileges.
If the script is not executable, you can solve this issue by executing the following command: +
`opsi-set-rights /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/opsi-deploy-client-agent`.

The script creates the client on the server, then copies the installation files and the configuration information, including the pckey, to the client.  After copying the necessary information, `opsi-deploy-client-agent` starts the installation on the client.

There are two ways to copy the installation files.
The first method will use the 'mount'-command on the server to mount the C$ share of the client, and copy the files to the share for installation.
The second variant will use 'smbclient'-command on the server for mounting C$ share of the client, and copy the files to the share for installation.

With the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script you can also install to a list of clients.
To do this, either any number of clients can be passed as the last parameter or the clients can be read from a file using the '-f' option.
When using a file, there must be a client on every line.

The script can work with IP addresses, hostnames or FQDNs. It will try to automatically detect what type of address it is processing.

Possible parameters can be found by using `--help`:
