[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base]]
= {opsi-Server} Basic installation

In this section different variants of the installation of an '{opsi-server}' are shown.
You will end up with a server system ready for final configuration and commissioning.
To evaluate opsi we recommend using the <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm,pre-installed virtual machine>>.
Otherwise, you should select the operating system you are most familiar with.
In this case please make sure that the packages of the server are up to date.

If a proxy server is used in your network to access the Internet, remember to enter this on your {opsi-server} as well.
In particular the environment variables `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`.

In case of problems you can check the link:https://forum.opsi.org[free support] provided by the community.


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm]]
== Starting up the uib preconfigured Virtual Machine

An '{opsi-server}' can be installed as a virtual machine, because the load on the system is low.
A ready-to-use and pre-configured virtual machine is provided by uib.
You can download the VMware or Virtualbox files from the link:https://uib.de/[uib website] or link:https://opsi.org/[opsi.org].
The free of charge VMware player or Virtualbox is sufficient to run this machine.
You may also use VMware server or ESXi.

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-start]]
=== First Start

*VMware*

If you have a server running VMware or VMware player, it only takes a few mouse clicks to install a base '{opsi-server}':

* Download the opsi server VM from link:https://opsi.org/try-opsi/[opsi.org]
* Unzip the file and a directory 'opsivm' will be generated.
* Start VMware player.
Open "Open a Virtual Machine", look for the directory `opsivm` and in it the file `opsivm.ovf` in its file selection dialog. You may have to change the file types to be displayed to ovf.
You can now import the server under its own name. The virtual server can then be started.

*ESXi-Server*

* Download the opsi server VM from link:https://opsi.org/try-opsi/[opsi.org]
* Unzip the file and a directory 'opsivm' will be generated.
* Start vSphere Client. +
Install a new client with 'File' / 'Deploy OVF Template....' and answer the next questions.

*Virtualbox*

* Download the opsi server VM from link:https://opsi.org/try-opsi/[opsi.org]
* Unzip the file and a directory 'opsivm' will be generated.
* Start Virtualbox. +
At the menu 'File' / 'Import Appliance' select your `opsivm.ovf` file and import it.

*General*

The VMware player is free of charge and available for all common operating systems at link:https://www.vmware.com/[vmware.com].
Usually it can be installed without any problems, as long as the resources of the host computer (especially memory) meet the needs of running software systems in parallel.

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-lang]]
=== Language selection
The first step is to choose the preferred language:

.Language selection
image::1stboot-language-selection.png["Screenshot: Language selection", pdfwidth=90%]

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-1stboot]]
=== First boot

The {opsi-server} needs to be connected to the Internet to work properly. The script `1stboot.py` will automatically start at the first boot in order to configure the {opsi-server} network settings.
If something goes wrong while running '1stboot.py', then you may run `1stboot.py` again from the command line.

The log file of `1stboot.py` is located at `/var/lib/1stboot/1stboot.log`.

WARNING: You cannot use `1stboot.py` to rename your '{opsi-server}' afterwards!

.Startup mask
image::1st-startup-mask.png["Screenshot: 1stboot.py Startup mask", pdfwidth=90%]

Fill in the configuration information for your network and answer the questions.

.Input mask
image::1stboot-input-mask.png["Screenshot: 1stboot Input mask", pdfwidth=90%]

In the following, you will be asked for:

server name::		Name of this server (without domain) e.g. +opsidemo+

domain::		DNS-Domain (not Windows-Domain) the name has to include a dot e.g. +opsi.local+

ip address::		Address of this server e.g. +192.168.1.50+

netmask::		Netmask of this server e.g. +255.255.255.0+

windows domain::	Name of the Windows Domain (not the DNS domain)

gateway::	IP-address of the Internet gateway e.g. +192.168.1.1+

proxy::	If required for Internet access, the proxy information: e.g. `http://myuser:mypass@<proxy-address>:8080`

DNS server:: IP address of the name server e.g. +192.168.1.1+

mail relay:: IP address of the mail server e.g. +192.168.1.1+

tftp server::	IP address of the tftp server (usually the server)

Password of root::	Password of root

Password of adminuser::	Password of local opsi-admin.

After the program '1stboot.py' finishes, the virtual machine will be rebooted.


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-second-start]]
=== Second Start

After the reboot, or after completing the network configuration, login as 'adminuser' with your password.

The graphical user interface of the {opsi-server} should have already started (a lightweight window manager is used).
A "Firefox" browser window appears at startup, and displays this document and further information.

If you get a message that there is no network connection, this might be caused by the special configuration of the virtual appliance.
Before trying other options, you should reboot the server again. (i.e. use the shutdown button in the GUI)

.Graphical view of fresh started opsi-server
image::opsiserver_start_gui.png["Screenshot: View of newly started opsi-server", pdfwidth=90%]

If the network was correctly configured in the previous steps, then you should be able to remotely access the {opsi-server}, for example:

* use 'ssh' at the command line to access the server ('ssh' should already be installed on linux systems, for Windows use link:https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/[putty]) +
Use 'root' as the user name, and authenticate with the root password.

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-term]]
=== Terminal Window

In the following sections, some commands have to be entered into a command line interface. It may be the easiest way to work through these instructions.

The commands are input into a window called a "terminal window". Here are examples that explain how to access a terminal window:

* Remote access per ssh on the {opsi-server} (see previous section)

* Open a terminal window in the {opsi-server} graphical interface with a click on the terminal icon in the icon bar.

* Open a terminal window in the {opsi-server} graphical interface with a right mouse click inside the interface, and choose "Terminal". +
Note: the graphical interface has multiple desktops that are reachable using the variety of buttons in the upper-left-hand corner of the display.

We recommend cutting and pasting commands from this handbook directly into the {opsi-server} terminal window (most applications support cut and paste).

Example snippets from configuration files are formatted like this:
[source,configfile]
----
depoturl = smb://smbhost/sharename/path
----

Example snippets for commands that you have to execute are formatted like this:
[source,prompt]
----
cd /tmp
ls -l
----

Angle brackets '< >' mark abstract names. When entering commands, please replace the '<abstract name>' with a real name. +
For example: The file share, where opsi places the software packages, may abstractly be noted as '<opsi-depot-share>'. If the real file share is `/var/lib/opsi/depot`, then you have to replace the abstract name by this exact string.
The location of the package '<opsi-depot-share>/ooffice' becomes `/var/lib/opsi/depot/ooffice`. .

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-network]]
=== Check the Network Connection

If the network configuration is correct, and the computer is connected to the Internet, then you can access any website using the browser in the start window.

If not everything is working, then you have to open a terminal window (maybe this is not yet possible from a remote connection, only from the server GUI) and then perform the necessary network connection checks and fixes.

You can re-enter the network configuration by entering this command in the terminal window:
[source,prompt]
----
1stboot.py
----

A reboot is forced with the command:
[source,prompt]
----
reboot
----

If the network connection works, then you can install opsi packages or update them, and configure the environment for the first installation test. If you want to use the virtual machine (and not install the {opsi-server} directly to your host system), then skip to xref:server/configuration.adoc#opsi-getting-started-installation-config[Update and Configuration of the opsi-server].

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-update-server]]
=== Update the opsi-Server

To update your {opsi-server} you need to double click the Icon 'Update OS' on the desktop. To do this please enter the current password for the adminuser and confirm if necessary.

include::apt-proxy-config.adoc[]

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-update-opsi-product]]
=== Install the standard opsi-products

By performing a double click the Icon 'First package installation' the minimal opsi-products will be installed. To do this please enter the current password for the +adminuser+.
This automatically fetches the current opsi packages, including templates for OS deployments, from the opsi repositories and installs them on the server.

For more information see xref:server/minimal-products.adoc#opsi-getting-started-installation-config-get-essential-products[Importing the minimal opsi products].


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-vm-start-configed]]
=== Starting opsi-Server Interface

You can start the management interface by double clicking on the icon 'Opsi Configuration Editor'.
For a description of the management interface check xref:opsiconfiged#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-configed-start[Installation of the management interface opsi-configed].

You have a running opsi server now, i.e. the opsi application itself is fully configured.

You can now proceed with:

* xref:adding-clients.adoc#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration[Integration of existing Windows clients]

* xref:os-installation.adoc#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall[Installation of a new Windows PC with opsi (OS Installation)]


include::common:partial$quickinstall.adoc[leveloffset=+1]


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-prerequires]]
== Prerequisites for an installation on a server

From version 4.2 the opsi-server needs access to a Redis and a Grafana instance.
If these services will also be provided by the opsi server, we recommend switching to the _opsi-server-full_ package during the migration. This package installs and configures everything that is necessary on the opsi server (this will be referred to as a single server setup). This recommendation applies to all supported operating systems, except for Univention UCS. As previously, the opsi4ucs package should be installed on these systems.

NOTE: The _opsi-server-full_ package installs all necessary components to run opsi on one server. +
If certain components should not be installed, for example if Redis, MySQL or Grafana should run on another server, +
the packages _opsi-server_ or _opsi-server-expert_ can be used instead.

We recommend using the official Grafana repositories for Grafana:

=== Debian/Ubuntu/UCS:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/keyrings
REPO_URL=https://apt.grafana.com
REPO_KEY=/usr/local/share/keyrings/grafana.gpg
apt install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common curl gpg
curl -fsSL ${REPO_URL}/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | tee ${REPO_KEY} > /dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=${REPO_KEY}] ${REPO_URL} stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list
----

=== RHEL/CentOS/Alma/Rocky:

[source,bash]
----
yum install wget
cd /etc/yum.repos.d
cat <<EOF > grafana.repo
[grafana]
name=grafana
baseurl=https://rpm.grafana.com
repo_gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.grafana.com/gpg.key
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
EOF
----

=== openSUSE/SLES:

[source,bash]
----
zypper install wget
cd /etc/zypp/repos.d
cat <<EOF > grafana.repo
[grafana]
name=grafana
baseurl=https://rpm.grafana.com
repo_gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://rpm.grafana.com/gpg.key
sslverify=1
sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
EOF
----

NOTE: If you want to use mysql instead of `mariaDB`, then you must specify a user with `mysql_native_password` when using `opsi-setup --configure-mysql`.

To activate mysql_native_password for the root user, the following steps are necessary:

* enter `skip-grant-tables` in the mysql configuration under `[mysqld]`.
* restart mysql service
* log in as root with mysql -u root -p
* `flush privileges;` and
* `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'NewPassword';` execute.
* Remove `skip-grant-tables` again and restart the service.


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-deb]]
== Installation on Debian / Ubuntu

In this chapter, we assume you are familiar with the debian package system (you will find information about this in the appropriate Debian books, in the manual pages, or under https://www.debian.org/doc/[debian documentation]).

IMPORTANT: Please check the xref:server/requirements.adoc#opsi-getting-started-requirements[requirements] and <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-prerequires,preperations>>!

We recommend to install the following packages:

[source,bash]
----
apt install host pigz apt-transport-https software-properties-common curl gpg
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/keyrings
----

Furthermore, samba needs to be installed:

[source,bash]
----
apt install samba samba-common smbclient cifs-utils
----

To start with the installation of opsi add the opsi repository to apt:

*Ubuntu 22.04 LTS _Jammy Jellyfish_:*

uid           home:uibmz:opsi OBS Project <home:uibmz:opsi@build.opensuse.org>
----


include::apt-proxy-config.adoc[]


Before installing the opsi packages, make sure that your server has a valid FQDN:
[source,prompt]
----
hostname -f
----

The output FQDN must contain at least two dots (see: xref:server/requirements.adoc#opsi-getting-started-requirements-software-dns-domainname[requirements]).


Execute the following commands in order to install opsi on your server:

*Single server setup:*
[source,prompt]
----
apt update
apt install opsi-server-full
----

*Manual setup:*
[source,prompt]
----
apt update
apt install redis-server redis-timeseries grafana mariadb-server
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable grafana-server
systemctl start grafana-server
apt install opsi-server
apt install opsi-windows-support
----

If you are asked for the tftp directory during the tftpd-installation answer with _/tftpboot_.

Assuming all of the above steps completed successfully, we can assume that the network is properly configured. +
Next continue on with xref:server/configuration.adoc#opsi-getting-started-installation-config[configuration].


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs]]
== Installation on a Univention Corporate Server (UCS)


IMPORTANT: Please check the xref:server/requirements.adoc#opsi-getting-started-requirements[configuration requirements] and <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-prerequires,preperations>>!


The installation on a Univention Corporate Server is possible through the Univention App Center as well as the classic way by using the repositories maintained by uib.

Both are equally supported methods of installations. We recommend using only one method per server.
If new packages for an operating system are released they are available right away if the repositories maintained by uib are used.
If the installation is made through the App Center the change to a newer UCS version (i.e. from UCS 4.4 to UCS 5) will be blocked until all installed apps are available for the new version of the operating system.

With opsi 4.2 the ucs support was adepted to the opsi-standard like on other supported distibutions. The function of opsi4ucs was implemented in opsi-server package and its variants.
The opsi4ucs package exists in opsi 4.2 as a transitionpackage to make the migration easier. This package will automatically removed during the upgrade process.

The first {opsi-Server} in an environment will have its backend configured to make use of the installed MySQL server.
All subsequent servers will be registered as depots in opsi.

////
[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs-appcenter]]
=== Installation through Univention App-Center

In the Univention App-Center an automatic installation of the {opsi-server} is available.
The installation-app for opsi can be found in the UCS management interface in the category 'System'.
With the App-Center opsi can only be installed on a server with roles 'master', 'backup' or 'slave'.

If you want to update an existing opsi4ucs installation please check the next chapter for further information.

Additional packages will be installed automatically: 'opsi-tftpd-hpa', 'opsi-windows-support', 'univention-mariadb' respectively 'univention-mysql'.

If an existing {opsi-server} is detected 'opsi-package-updater' will be configured to retrieve packages from the existing server.
On installation 'opsi-package-updater' will be run to download and install a minimal set of opsi packages. This will not be done during an update.
On an major or minor update the package updates will installed automatically.

Please note that no automatic transfer of clients to opsi takes place.
More information at <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs-listener>>.

The opsi installation on a UCS server via the Univention App Center is now complete.
Continue with <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration>>


[[opsi-getting-started-installation-upgrade-appcenter]]
=== Upgrading an existing opsi-Installation from UCS 3 to UCS 4 (over the App-Center)

One of the important changes in opsi 4.0.5 is support for the group 'opsifileadmins'. This group will in the future replace the group 'pcpatch' in UCS.
The group 'opsifileadmins' has already been introduced with the support of UCS 3.0, but would only be used on installations that had Samba 4 and the Univention Directory Services (Samba4-AD) installed.
In all other variants and roles the group 'pcpatch' continues to be used, as before. +
Since this situation represents a problem not only on the installation, but could also lead to potential problems with migrations (especially from Samba3 to Samba4) since the release of 4.0.5 the group 'pcpatch' will be created as 'opsifileadmins'.

WARNING: To implement this in the integration package in a clean way, an already existing group 'pcpatch' will be renamed automatically to 'opsifileadmins'.
This is done via the join script. If your config server is run on a server with the role 'master' or 'backup' the join script will be executed automatic. +
 +
The main reason for this drastic measure is that the manual rename of this group is not trivial, because it is a primary group. Therefore it is recommended before installing this update to make sure that your group is still named 'pcpatch'. If so, the update should be started first on the config server and then on the depot servers as well.
Otherwise the operation on multi depot-environments could lead to issues. If your group is already named 'opsifileadmins' there should be no issues. Nevertheless, it is recommended after installing the update to check every opsi server to verify complete functionality.
////

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs-manually]]
=== Manual opsi-installation on UCS (without App-Center)

IMPORTANT: Please check the xref:server/requirements.adoc#opsi-getting-started-requirements[requirements] and <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-prerequires,preperations>>!

Necessary preparations:

* Samba has to be configured. For the use on a server with the 'member' role, `univention-samba` has to be used instead of `univention-samba4`.

* `univention-mariadb` or `univention-mysql` has to be installed.

* If the machine should also work as DHCP-server, then the dhcpd daemon has to be configured and should be running.

The installation of opsi is possible on a server with the roles 'master', 'backup', 'slave' or 'member'.
For the installation on a 'member' you need to read <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs-member>>!

The following documentation describes an installation on a 'master' with Samba 4.

CAUTION: When installing on a 'slave' the server must be already joined to the 'master' and Samba 4 has to be installed first. +
UCS configuration is usually done on the 'master' while the installation and configuration of opsi takes place on the 'slave'.

The classic installation with the user 'pcpatch' in the primary group 'pcpatch' cannot be adhered to with UCS. Samba 4 has the same fundamental restrictions as Active-Directory, so groups with the same name as a user are not allowed.
For this reason the configuration file `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf` has been introduced for UCS 3. This file controls how the group used for the Samba shares will be named. Since UCS 3 the group name 'pcpatch' will be renamed to 'opsifileadmins' with this file.
This means that users that need rights for opsi (opsi package builders for example) should not be members of the group 'pcpatch' but must be members of the group 'opsifileadmins'. This peculiarity applies only to UCS and is different to other distributions and different to the next chapters in the opsi-documentation.
With UCS the user 'pcpatch' is created as a full domain user. For more information about this new configuration file please refer to the opsi-manual.

* Next add the opsi4ucs repository:*

*Univention UCS 4.4:*
[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
----
REPO_URL=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/uibmz:/opsi:/4.2:/{release}/Univention_4.4
REPO_KEY=/usr/local/share/keyrings/opsi.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=${REPO_KEY}] ${REPO_URL}/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opsi.list
curl -fsSL ${REPO_URL}/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee ${REPO_KEY} > /dev/null
----


*Univention UCS 5.0:*
[source,bash]
[subs="attributes"]
----
REPO_URL=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/uibmz:/opsi:/4.2:/{release}/Univention_5.0
REPO_KEY=/usr/local/share/keyrings/opsi.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=${REPO_KEY}] ${REPO_URL}/ /" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opsi.list
curl -fsSL ${REPO_URL}/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee ${REPO_KEY} > /dev/null
----



For installation the following commands must be entered next:

*Single server setup:*
[source,bash]
----
univention-install opsi-server-full
----

*Manual setup:*
[source,bash]
----
univention-install redis-server redis-timeseries grafana
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable grafana-server
systemctl start grafana-server
univention-install opsi-server
----

If the role of the target system different than 'master' or 'backup' then we have to run the opsi4ucs Join-Script:

[source,bash]
----
univention-run-join-scripts
----

A link to the management interface can be found at the URL `https://<servername>:4447`.

To use the opsi configuration editor the user has to be a member of the group {opsi-admin-group}. The group membership can be edited by using Univention-Admin. The user Administrator will automatically be added to this group during the opsi installation.

Finally, in UDM, for the 'opsi_depot'-share we have to set the following option under Advanced Settings -> Advanced Samba Settings: 'follow symlinks' must be set to 'yes'. The same should be done for the 'opsi_depot_rw'-share, so the driver integration will run without problems. If the directory `/var/lib/opsi/depot` is located on an extra partition or hard disk then the option for wide links should be set to 'yes'.

To make sure that opsi is running with the proper settings restart opsi by entering the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
opsi-setup --init-current-config
opsi-set-rights
systemctl restart opsiconfd.service
systemctl restart opsipxeconfd.service
----

Please be advised that samba 4 will not be automatically restarted, since it is a important service on which other software may depend. You have to restart it manually. After restarting samba there may be a slight delay before the new shares are accessible.

Because there is no direct connection between the Univention LDAP and the opsi-backend all Clients have to be created twice. First in the Univention-LDAP using UDM and then in opsi including all system information (in particular the MAC address). Deleting a LDAP client in Univention will not delete the client in opsi and vice versa.
This problem is further discussed in <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs-listener>>.

Since opsi was installed on an existing server we assume that the network configuration is correct. +
Continue with the installation by skipping forward to xref:server/configuration#opsi-getting-started-installation-config[configuration].

WARNING: The Unix commands used in the following chapters are for Debian systems. You may have to change them to match your Linux system.

[[opsi-getting-started-installation-base-ucs-member]]
=== Hints about installing opsi on an UCS server with the role 'member'

Installing opsi on a server with the role 'member' is possible.

After an installation you need to make sure that the user that will be used to access the depot exists in the current domain.
Check the host parameter `clientconfig.depot.user` for this.
Let's assume that the domain is `backstage`, then the value has to be `backstage\pcpatch`. If it is `memberserver\pcpatch` then it has to be changed.

Setting the password for the user `pcpatch` through `opsi-admin` fails because of the missing AD write access of a 'member' server.
To change the password you have to do so *additionally* on a server with write access - a 'master', 'backup' or 'slave'.

=== PXE-Boot configuration for operating system installation

If the PXE-Boot should be used for OS installations the DHCP-service on the relevant UCS-System has to be reconfigured. There are two characteristics which differentiate UCS from other supported distributions.

* The configuration is not made automatically during the opsi installation on an active UCS infrastructure because often the configuration is already in use.
* The opsi-tftpd-hpa is not configured as usual using the directory `/tftpboot` as base directory, instead the `/var/lib/univention-client-boot` is used. All important files of {opsi-linux-bootimage} will be moved from `/tftpboot` to the base directory. The side effect is that the DHCP-Option filename must be `pxelinux.0` instead of `linux/pxelinux.0`.

To implement these settings, a policy must be created in the UCS system. This policy interacts with the existing policies, and has to be implemented appropriately. If opsi was installed on an UCS test system without existing policies, check if the DHCP-service is installed. If the DHCP-service is already installed the easiest way to create the policy is in the UMC-webinterface (Univention Management Console) of the UCS-server. To do this choose the category "Domain" and underneath the module DHCP-server. Next you have to choose the service (in a testing system you will usually find only one entry). In the following view choose the menuitem policies. The policy we need is a DHCP-Boot policy. In the policy configuration choose `cn=default-settings` as default entry (there should be only one entry) and choose 'edit'. Under basic settings - DHCP-boot enter for the bootserver option the IP address of the {opsi-server} and enter for the boot-filename option `pxelinux.0`.

WARNING: If the policy is configured like mentioned above, this affects every device that uses DHCP from this server. Therefore, this instruction is meant only for testing opsi and UCS together. In a productive UCS environment you should not configure this policy as described previously.

Optionally, these settings can be done at the console with the udm command. You can find more information about this in the UCS-documentation.

=== Synchronising data from LDAP to opsi

In an opsi4ucs installation Windows clients have to be created in the UDM first and then they have to be created in {opsi-configed}.
Changes to the client in UDM will not be passed on to opsi.
For example if a client's MAC address changes in LDAP and in opsi a netboot-product is set to setup, the boot configuration would be provided with an incorrect MAC address.

The solution for this is the extension 'opsi-directory-connector'.
Please consult the manual for more information.

== Installation on openSUSE or Suse Linux Enterprise Server (SLES)

IMPORTANT: Please check the xref:server/requirements.adoc#opsi-getting-started-requirements[requirements] and <<opsi-getting-started-installation-base-prerequires,preperations>>!


Necessary preparations:

* Samba must be installed and configured.

* `mariadb-server` must be installed.

* If the machine should also act as DHCP-server then the dhcpd daemon has to be configured and running.

You can use zypper to add the opsi repositories:

After adding the repository, the installation can be started:

*Single server setup:*
[source,prompt]
----
zypper refresh
  Do you want to (r)eject the Key, (t)emporary or (a)lways trust? [r/t/a/?] (a): a

----

*Manual setup:*
[source,prompt]
----
zypper refresh
zypper install redis-server redis-timeseries grafana
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable grafana-server
systemctl start grafana-server
zypper -v install opsi-server
zypper -v install opsi-windows-support
----

Please make sure that your firewall configuration allows connections to the following ports:

* tftp: 69/UDP
* opsi: 4447/TCP and 4441/TCP

In case you used an utility like yast or autoyast to help you with your network configuration it is possible the tool created an entry in the `/etc/hosts` file like:
[source,configfile]
----
127.0.0.2 <fqdn> <hostname>
----

If you want to leave the configuration of the DHCP server to opsi, this entry has to be changed to the public IP address of the server.

Please continue with xref:server/configuration#opsi-getting-started-installation-config[configuration].
