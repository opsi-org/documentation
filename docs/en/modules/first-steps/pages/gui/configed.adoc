= opsi User Interface

There are currently two graphical interfaces available for managing the opsi server, clients, and related tasks:

* The Java application xref:gui:configed.adoc[*opsi-configed*]
* The xref:gui:webgui.adoc[opsi-WebGUI] for web browsers

This chapter will focus on the `opsi-configed` interface.

== *opsi-configed*: Download and Start

You can access a portable version of the application at link:https://tools.43.opsi.org/{release}/[]. Download `opsi-configed` suitable for your operating system: `opsi-configed-windows.exe` for Windows, `opsi-configed-linux.run` for Linux, and `opsi-configed-macos` for macOS.

NOTE: On Linux and macOS, you need to make the downloaded file executable. Use the `chmod` command:

[source,console]
----
chmod +x opsi-configed-linux.run
chmod +x opsi-configed-macos
----

Once you start the application, a login window will appear. Enter the full host name (FQDN) of the opsi server or its IP address, along with the username and password:

If everything was successful, the following window will open:

You should not see any clients and products yet. We will change this in the next step: xref:products/products.adoc[install products].
