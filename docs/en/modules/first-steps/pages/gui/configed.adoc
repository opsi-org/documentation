# opsi user interfaces

At the moment there are two interfaces to configure the opsi-server. 
One is the Java application xref:gui:configed.adoc[opsi-configed] and the other is xref:gui:webgui.adoc[{opsi-webgui}]. In this chapter we use the opsi-configed.

## Download and start opsi-configed

A portable version of the opsi-configed application can be found at: link:https://tools.43.opsi.org/{release}/[]
Download the configed and run the programme. 

NOTE: On Linux and MacOS, the file may need to be given "execute" permissions. 


After starting the application, the login window will open. 
Here you enter the FQDN or IP of the server, user name and password.

If everything was successful, the following window will open:

You should not see any clients and products yet. We will change this in the next step: xref:products/products.adoc[install products].
