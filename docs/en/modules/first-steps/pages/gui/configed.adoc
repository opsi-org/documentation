= opsi User Interface

There are currently two graphical interfaces available for managing the opsi server, clients, and related tasks:

* The Java application xref:gui:configed.adoc[*opsi-configed*]
* The xref:gui:webgui.adoc[opsi-WebGUI] for web browsers

This chapter will focus on the `opsi-configed` interface.

== *opsi-configed*: Download and Start

You can access a portable version of the application at link:https://tools.43.opsi.org/{release}/[]. Download `opsi-configed` suitable for your operating system: `opsi-configed-windows.exe` for Windows, `opsi-configed-linux.run` for Linux, and `opsi-configed-macos` for macOS.

NOTE: On Linux and macOS, you need to make the downloaded file executable. Use the `chmod` command:

[source,console]
----
chmod +x opsi-configed-linux.run
chmod +x opsi-configed-macos
----

Once you start the application, a login window will appear. Enter the full hostname (FQDN) of the opsi server or its IP address, along with the username and password:

.*opsi-configed*: Login
image::opsi-configed-login.png["*opsi-configed*: Login", width=400, pdfwidth=80%]

If your login is successful, the main window will be displayed:

.*opsi-configed*: Main Window
image::opsi-configed-clients.png["*opsi-configed*: Main Window", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

The screenshot provided already displays clients and opsi products. However, in your initial setup, these elements may not yet be visible in your environment. To learn how to deploy products (opsi packages) to the server, please proceed to the next chapter.
