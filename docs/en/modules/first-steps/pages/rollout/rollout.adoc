= Deploying Products to the Clients

Next, we're going to roll out the `hwaudit` product to all clients. This product conducts a hardware inventory, gathering information about all devices. For this process, we'll use the xref:gui:configed.adoc[Management Interface *opsi-configed*]. As an alternative, you can also deploy the product using the xref:gui:webgui.adoc[opsi WebGUI].

TIP: You can find a comprehensive description of products, their deployment to clients, and more in the xref:clients:opsi-clients.adoc[client manuals].

Within the interface, start by selecting one or more clients. Then, navigate to the _Localboot products_ tab. Here, choose the `hwaudit` product from the list and click in the _Requested action_ column. A drop-down menu will appear; select the _setup_ option. To execute the action immediately, open the context menu with a right-click and choose the _Save and execute_ option.

The product is now being deployed to the selected clients. Once the status in the _Requested action_ column changes from _setup_ to _installed_, you will be able to view the results of the hardware inventory on the _Hardware information_ tab.

You can now install additional products on the server and subsequently deploy them to the clients.

NOTE: It is not necessary to deploy products immediately. You can choose to wait until the next boot. The clients will automatically process any pending actions before the user logs on.
