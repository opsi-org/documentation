= Install products

For the distribution of software with opsi, ready-made products are available for installation. One of these products is the xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc[Client-Agent (Windows)], which must be installed on all clients to enable administration with opsi.


// cspell: ignore updater
To install the packages on the server open a terminal via the opsi-configed: 
_window_ => _terminal_.

Then enter the following command to install the *opsi-client-agent* and *hwaudit* packages.

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater -v install opsi-client-agent hwaudit
----

NOTE: How to configure the opsi-package-updater or install packages manually can be found in chapter xref:clients:windows-client/minimal-products.adoc[Deploy Products (Server)]. If you want to create your own opsi packages, see xref:clients:windows-client/software-integration.adoc[Integrating your own software] for detailed instructions.

Next we can register one or more clients with the server: xref:clients/client-installation.adoc[Add clients].
