= Adding Products (Server)

Ready-made products for software distribution are readily available with opsi, which you should initially install on the server. Among these products, you'll find the xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc[Client-Agent (Windows)]. opsi uses a dedicated agent on the client computers, designed to facilitate smooth and automatic installations and updates, completely independent of user involvement.

== Installing *opsi-client-agent* and *hwaudit*

To install the two products `opsi-client-agent` and `hwaudit` (for hardware inventory) on the opsi server, you need to open a terminal window on the server. This can be done either locally or through SSH.

TIP: Alternatively, you can access a terminal directly from the `opsi-configed` interface. Simply select _Terminal_ from the _Windows_ menu:

.*opsi-configed*: Open a Terminal

To install the `opsi-client-agent` and `hwaudit` packages, enter the following command in the terminal:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater -v install opsi-client-agent hwaudit
----

NOTE: For configuring the `opsi-package-updater` or for manual installation of packages, refer to the chapter xref:clients:windows-client/minimal-products.adoc[Adding Products (Server)]. If you are interested in creating your own opsi packages, detailed instructions can be found in xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc[Integrating custom  Software].

The next step is to register one or more clients on the server.
