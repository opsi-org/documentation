= Adding Products (Server)

Ready-made products for software distribution are readily available with opsi, which you should initially install on the server. Among these products, you'll find the xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc[Client-Agent (Windows)]. opsi uses a dedicated agent on the client computers, designed to facilitate smooth and automatic installations and updates, completely independent of user involvement.

== Installing *opsi-client-agent* and *hwaudit*

To install the two products `opsi-client-agent` and `hwaudit` (for hardware inventory) on the opsi server, you need to open a terminal window on the server. This can be done either locally or through SSH.

TIP: Alternatively, you can access a terminal directly from the `opsi-configed` interface. Simply select _Terminal_ from the _Windows_ menu:

.*opsi-configed*: Open a Terminal

To install the packages on the server open a terminal via the opsi-configed: 
_window_ => _terminal_.

Then enter the following command to install the *opsi-client-agent* and *hwaudit* packages.

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater -v install opsi-client-agent hwaudit
----

NOTE: How to configure the opsi-package-updater or install packages manually can be found in chapter xref:clients:windows-client/minimal-products.adoc[Deploy Products (Server)]. If you want to create your own opsi packages, see xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc[Integrating your own software] for detailed instructions.

Next we can register one or more clients with the server: xref:clients/client-installation.adoc[Add clients].
