[[opsi-manual-localboot-products]]
= Localboot products: automatic software distribution with opsi

Localboot products are all products that are installed by the 'opsi-client-agent' after the computer started the installed OS. This is in contrast to the netboot products described below xref:opsi-products:netboot-products.adoc#opsi-manual-netboot-products[Netboot products].


[[opsi-manual-localboot-standardprodukte]]
== opsi standard products

The following localboot products are part of the default installation of opsi.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-activate-win]]
=== activate-win

Activate Windows: 

* by using different methods controlled by the properties

* by using different license key sources

[[opsi-manual-localboot-config-win10]]
=== config-win10

Configures various Windows 10 settings such as lock screen, hibernation boot, sending telemetry and update behavior.

See also: xref:localboot-products.adoc#opsi-manual-localboot-microsoft-windows-policies[microsoft-windows-policies].

* *allow_useractivity_publishing* allows Microsoft to collect userctivity experiences

* *change_power_plan* changes the power management profile.

* *config_updates* allows you to change the source of the updates. The updates are then downloaded either directly from Microsoft servers, a local peer-to-peer network or a peer-to-peer network from the Internet. The 'disable' option is meanwhile moved into a separate property called 'disable_updates'.

* *defer_upgrade* postpones updates and upgrades. Updates can be postponed by four weeks and upgrades by eight months. It should be noted that security-relevant updates are installed despite the 'defer' option. However, feature updates are not installed.

* *deferfeatureupdatesperiodindays* Defines how long quality updates, also called windows upgrades, should be defered. The maximum is 365 days.

* *deferqualityupdatesperiodindays* Defines how many days feature updates should be defered. The maximum is 29 days.

* *disable_advertising_id* deactivates the so-called Advertising ID. This stores data about the browser history in order to display user-specific advertising.

* *disable_app_suggestion_in_startmenu* deactivates suggested apps in the start menu.

* *disable_automatic_logon_on_reboot*: disables an automatic logon after reboot.

* *disable_cortana* deactivates the Cortana voice assistant. This collects various data about input and transfers this data to Microsoft servers.

* *disable_customer_experience* disables collecting data related to application usage data.

* *disable_defender* disables the anti-virus protection included with Windows 10 called 'Defender'.

* *disable_dosvc* disbales a service used for delivery optimization.

* *disable_error_report* deactivates sending error reports to Microsoft. This does not affect third party apps.

* *disable_fast_boot* deactivates fast boot and ensures that the standard opsi-event gui_startup works properly.

* *disable_font_streaming* ensures that fonts not installed on the system are streamed from the Internet.

* *disable_handwrite_sharing* A special feature is the use of Windows 10 on tablet PCs. Here, data about handwriting is collected and sent to a Microsoft server.

* *disable_location_sensors* disables collecting data about the current geolocation of the device.

* *disable_lock_screen* disables the lock screen.

* *disable_mrt* deactivates the use of the 'Malware Removal Tool', MRT for short. This service scans existing files on the computer's hard drive at regular intervals and compares them with a list of potentially dangerous software.

* *disable_news_and_interest* deactivates news and interest in the taskbar.

* *disable_onedrive_sync* disables the OneDrive file synchronization.

* *disable_push_install* disables the possibility to push install apps from the Microsoft store from another device with the same account.

* *disable_recent_apps* disables the presentation of recently used apps in the start menu.

* *disable_sending_feedback* makes it possible to influence the transfer of data to Microsoft in the event of application crashes.

* *disable_smbv1* disables the SMB v1 protocol.

* *disable_suggested_silent_app_installion* deactivates a silent installation of suggested apps in the background without user interaction.

* *disable_telemetry* makes it possible to limit the amount of data collected. A lot of data is transferred as standard. If the property is set to 'true', Windows is set so that only security-relevant data is transferred. This is the lowest level. This security level can only be set in the Windows 10 Enterprise and LTSB version. In the other versions of Windows 10, the next lowest level is applied, Basic.

* *disable_update_button* disables the update button within the update settings. If set to false after it was set to true it might take a couple of hours to make the button usable again.

* *disable_update_service* disables the windows update service and provides another possibility to block updates.

* *disable_updates* blocks connections to Microsoft update sources when set to 'true'. Setting the property to 'false' enables these connections again.

* *disable_wifi_sense* deactivates the service called 'Wifi Sense'. This service enables saved WLAN configurations to be shared with contacts. +

* *flashplayer_autorun* There is a security vulnerablility in Windows 10 with the Adobe Flashplayer. It is recommended to deactivate the autorun feature of the flash player. With 'false' the Flashplayer is no longer started.

* *hide_known_file_extensions* hides known file extensions, e.g. txt.

* *local_wsus_available*: Only affects Windows Updates: When 'true' a connection to a local WSUS server is possible.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-swaudit_hwaudit]]
=== swaudit + hwaudit: Products for hard- and software-audit

The hwaudit and swaudit products are used for hardware and software inventory.
The hardware data is collected via WMI and reported back to the server via the 'opsi-Webservice'.
For the software inventory the information is taken from the registry key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall)and reported back to the server via the 'opsi-Webservice'.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-jedit]]
=== jedit

Java based editor with syntax highlighting for 'opsi-script' scripts.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-microsoft-windows-policies]]
=== microsoft-windows-policies

Configures various Windows 10 settings. +
Like xref:localboot-products.adoc#opsi-manual-localboot-config-win10[config-win10] but the implementation is policy based. +
The product documentation will be found inside the product at the path: `documentation`.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-auto-update]]
=== opsi-auto-update

opsi-auto-update is a product to simplify the maintenance of the clients.

CAUTION: opsi-auto-update is not for clients running the WAN-extension. Use in this case: xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-outdated-to-setup[opsi-outdated-to-setup]

In essence, this product can be used to ensure that the installed products are up to date. +
The product sets all installed products,
whose version is not identical to that on the server,
for the client to setup.

Properties for managing exceptions:

* name: `products_to_exclude`
** description: (Blacklist) Which opsi product(s) should be excluded from update ? +
List of products that should not be installed even if there is an update (such as windomain)

* name: `products_to_exclude_by_regex`
** description: (Blacklist) Which opsi product(s) should be excluded from update (by regular expressions)? +
List of regular expressions that fit products that should not be installed even if there is an update (such as windomain)

* name: `products_to_include`
** description: (Whitelist) Which opsi product(s) should be checked for update ? ; If empty = all products +
Here you can enter a list of products to which the update check should be limited. Products that are not in this list are also not considered when checking for updates. Exception: If the list is empty, all products are checked.



Properties for managing includes:

* name: `products_to_run_always`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should be installed via every update ? (List will not be cleared after run) +
List of products which are set to setup every time opsi-auto-update is run.

* name: `failed_products_to_setup`
** description: if true this also sets all failed products to setup on all clients +
If this is True, all products currently on failed are set to setup.

Properties for sequence control:

* name: `shutdown_on_finish`
** description: if true we have a final shutdown
if false we have no reboot / shutdown
default: False +
Should a shutdown me made after the product has finished?

////
* name: `setup_after_install`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should we switch to setup after update is done ? +
List of products which are set to setup after each run of opsi-auto-update. (e.g. shutdownwanted)
////

Special properties for 'local-image / vhd-reset': +
See also: xref:opsi-modules:vhd.adoc#opsi-manual-vhd[opsi vhd reset] +
See also: xref:opsi-modules:local-image.adoc#opsi-manual-localimage[opsi local image] +

* name: `do_cleanup`
** description: If false: skip restore before update +
This property is ignored if it is not a vhd or local image installation. +
For a vhd installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-vhd-control` before the updates, thereby discarding all changes and restoring the saved state. +
For a local-image installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-local-image-restore` before the updates, thereby discarding all changes and restoring the saved state. +
In both cases, information about action requests is also discarded. In order to be able to add or remove products during a run of `opsi-auto-update`, there are the following two properties.


* name: `products_to_install`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should be installed via update ? (List will be cleared after run) +
List of products which are set to setup during the opsi-auto-update run. If the products have been installed successfully, they will be removed from this list.

* name: `products_to_uninstall`
** description: Which opsi product(s) should be uninstalled via update ? (List will be cleared after run) +
List of products which are set to uninstall during the opsi-auto-update run. If the products have been uninstalled successfully, they will be removed from this list.

* name: `do_merge`
** description: If false: skip backup after update +
This property is ignored if it is not a vhd or local image installation. +
For a vhd installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-vhd-control` with `upgrade=true` after the updates and thus all changes are saved. +
For a local-image installation, do_cleanup=true executes `opsi-local-image-backup` after the updates and thus all changes are saved.

Properties for debugging: +

* name: `disabled` +
This property is for debugging purposes. +
If 'true', the product does not execute any actions. +
Default = 'false'

* name: `rebootflag` +
Please do not change during the run. This should be '0' before starting.

* name: `stop_after_step` +
This property is for debugging purposes. +
If not '0' then this is the number of reboots after which to stop.
Default = '0'

The `opsi-auto-update` product has a very low priority (-97),
which is even less than that of opsi-vhd-control.

The `opsi-auto-update` product can be combined well with a cron job that executes `opsi-wakeup-clients`. +
(opsi-wakeup-clients is part of the opsi-utils package) +

[[opsi-manual-localboot-opsi-win-driver-update]]
=== opsi-win-driver-update

CAUTION: opsi-auto-update is not for clients running the WAN-extension

The goal of this product is, to update the driver of existing windows machines from the standard netboot driver repository.

If you have new drivers for your machines, usually the first step is to integrate these drivers into the driver repository of the used netboot product.

How this is done is described in the opsi-windows-client-manual in the chapter: +
xref:clients:windows-client/os-installation.adoc#firststeps-osinstall-driverintegration-byaudit[Drivers automatically assigned to the clients using the inventory fields.]

and in the User Interface chapter: +
xref:gui:configed.adoc#opsi-manual-configed-driverupload[Automatic driver upload]

By default, the product tries to use the 'byAudit' driver repository of the netboot product used for the OS installation of this machine. The driver repository of this netboot product will be used for this product. +
The script tries to detected the used netbootproduct. You may use the property `netbootproduct` to define the netboot product to use. +
Using the property `driver_path` you may also point to a totally different driver repository. Such a driver repository will not be filtered by `<vendor>/<model>`. +

*The properties:* +

* name: `driver_path` +
description: Path to the driver directory. +
'auto'= from netboot product driver repo +
  default=auto

* name: `netbootproduct` +
description: name of the netboot product (where we can find the driver in driver_path auto mode). +
'auto'= try to detect the used netboot product +
  default=auto

* name: `force_import_cert_from_sys` +
description: if true, installation of not correct signed drivers will be possible by extracting the certs from the .sys file and import them to the cert store +
  default=false

* name: `force_reinstallation` +
description: if true, we try to install the driver even if it seems to be installed in the repo version +
  default=false

NOTE: The list of found path to drivers will be filtered by the following criteria:
All directories which contains one of the following pattern will be excluded: +
`autorun.inf, WINXP, XP, WIN200, WIN2K, VISTA, WINPE` +
On 64 Bit system all directories which contains one of the following pattern will be excluded: +
`32, x86, DrvBin32 ,WIN32, IA32, IA-32` +
On 32 Bit system all directories which contains one of the following pattern will be excluded: +

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order]]
== Dependencies and Order

For product action requests you may define product dependencies and product priorities.

=== Product priorities 
Priorities are used to push certain packages forward or backward in the order of installation. It makes sense to install service packs and patches first and a software inventory at the end of an installation sequence. +
Product priorities are numbers between 100 and -100 (0 is the default)

=== Product dependencies 
Defines dependencies and the necessary installation order between opsi-packages. A typical example is the dependency of Java programs on the Java Runtime Environment (javavm).

////
There are different possibilities how these two factors are used to determine the installation order. Therefore, opsi provides two algorithms.

Switch between these algorithms can be done either:

using 'opsi-configed', in the server configuration

.'opsi-configed': server configuration
image::configed_serverconfiguration_en.png["opsi-configed: server configuration", pdfwidth=90%]

or on the command line with the following command:
[source, shell]
----
opsi-setup --edit-config-defaults
----

.Choose the sort algorithm: Part 1
image::opsi-setup-product_sort_algorithm.png["Choose the sort algorithm: Part 1", pdfwidth=80%]

.Choose the sort algorithm: Part 2
image::opsi-setup-product_sort_algorithm2.png["Choose the sort algorithm: Part 2", pdfwidth=80%]

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-algorithm1]]
=== Algorithm1: product dependency before priority (default)

With this algorithm, the products are first sorted based on their priorities and then re-sorted based on the product dependencies. This of course allows a product with a very low priority to be pushed far forward because it is required by a product other than 'required before'. On the other hand, it prevents installation problems due to unresolved product dependencies. +
Algorithm 1 ensures that the installation order is constant, regardless of how many products are set to setup. This order corresponds to the order which is shown in configed when the products are sorted according to the position column. +
This ensures that if a setup script is only interrupted with "ExitWindows /immediateReboot", the processing of the interrupted script is continued immediately after the reboot.

[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-algorithm2]]
=== Algorithm2: product priority before dependency

This algorithm is based on the idea that in practice, there are essentially three priority classes:

* Products to be installed first such as OS patches and drivers that bring the PC to a standard state. Is realized by assigning a high priority (maximum +100).

* "Normal" products that install applications (default priority 0).

* Products that should be installed last, e.g. software inventory control. Realized by assigning a low priority (lowest possible -100).

Product dependencies are only resolved within a priority class. This ensures that products with a high priority are actually installed at the beginning. Cross-priority product dependencies are not taken into account or give a warning. It is therefore important to note when packaging that product dependencies are only defined within one priority class.

The product dependencies are interpreted here in such a way that with "normal" products they automatically lead to a consistent order that takes all dependencies into account. If contradictory (circular) dependencies have been defined, an error is displayed.

In the case of products with high priorities that are essential for setup of the computer, however, the administrator should set the exact order by hand - similar to, for example, Unix start-up scripts - by assigning a specific priority between +100 and +1 for each product according to the desired order. The same applies to the final products with low priorities.
////


[[opsi-manual-localboot-product-order-create]]
=== Defining product priorities and dependencies

Priorities and product dependencies belong to the metadata of an product. You will be asked for these when creating a product with the command `opsi-newprod`.

This metadata is stored in the control file of the product and can be edited there. After a change in the control file, the product must be repacked and installed again.
