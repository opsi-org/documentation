opsi QuickInstall is a tool designed to facilitate the installation of an opsi server on Linux. This program provides both graphical and command line interfaces for installation, and can be found on our link:https://tools.43.opsi.org/[servers].

[[opsi-quickinstall-download]]
== Downloading and unpacking QuickInstall

Download the zip file and unpack it. You can use the following command in the console:

[source,console]
----
unzip opsi-quick-install.zip
----

Alternatively, you can unzip the archive using the file manager of your graphical desktop environment. Right-click on the file and select _Unzip here_.

opsi-QuickInstall can be installed either with a graphical user interface or via the command line. The next two sections will describe both installation methods.

NOTE: The installer asks for so-called properties. For more information, please read the chapter on https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/manual/modules/linux.html#opsi-manual-linux-localboot-l-opsi-server[The Product *l-opsi-server*]. Here you can also find the default values of the properties. Note that for opsi QuickInstall the default for `allow_reboot` is set to `false`.

[[opsi-quickinstall-gui]]
== Graphical Setup Program

. Navigate to the `gui` directory in the file manager of your desktop environment and launch the installer `opsi_quick_install_project`, typically by double-clicking on it.

. In the dialog box that appears next, select your preferred language for the setup program from the drop-down menu at the top. Also, choose the _setup type_. Selecting _Custom_ allows you to access more detailed settings.
+
.Choose the Language and a Setup Type.

. Enter the name and password for the `opsiadmin` user (see the chapter xref:server:components/authorization.adoc[Authorizations]).
+
IMPORTANT: Be sure to choose a different name and a strong password and not the one shown in this example (<<Information>>).

. Click on _Overview_ to review your entered details. Once you confirm that everything is correct, click on _finish_. You will then be prompted to enter your password. Confirm by clicking on _finish_ again, and this will initiate the installation of the opsi server.

.The opsi server installation is running.
image::quickinstall_l-opsi-server.png["The opsi server installation is running.", pdfwidth=80%]

The installation of the opsi server might take several minutes to complete. Upon finishing, opsi QuickInstall will inform you if it was successful. If you see a `success` message, your opsi server is ready for use and fully configured. 

However, if you encounter an error message similar to the one shown in <<oqiFailed>>, you can refer to the logfiles for details on potential issues. These logs are located in two files: `/var/log/opsi-quick-install-l-opsi-server.log` and `/tmp/opsi_quickinstall.log`.

[[oqiFailed]]
.If the installation fails, please check the logfiles for error messages.

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui]]
== Installation on the Command Line

The directory `nogui` contains the program `opsi_quick_install_project`, which supports the following parameters:

* `-d`: The setup program uses the default values for the opsi server installation. It sets up the opsi admin user with the username `Alexandra` (opsi QuickInstall version 4.2.0.1) or `adminuser` (from version 4.2.0.1-2) and the password `linux123`.
+
IMPORTANT: For security reasons change these default values after the installation.
* `-f <file>`: The setup program uses the values from the specified file for the opsi server installation.
* `-n`: The setup program starts in interactive mode and asks for some parameters during the installation (*recommended*).

To start the setup program in interactive mode, enter this command:

[source,console]
----
sudo ./opsi_quick_install_project -n
----

After that, answer the questions. You can enter the following commands at any time:

* `-b`: jumps back to the previous question
* `-h`: displays additional information for questions that are marked with `*`
* [Enter]: uses the default values for a question

A summary at the end shows all your answers for a final check. If everything is correct, click [Enter] to start the installation of the opsi server.

The installation of the opsi server might take several minutes to complete. Upon finishing, opsi QuickInstall will inform you if it was successful. If you see a `success` message, your opsi server is ready for use and fully configured.

However, if you encounter an error message (`failed`), you can refer to the logfiles for details on potential issues. These logs are located in two files: `/var/log/opsi-quick-install-l-opsi-server.log` and `/tmp/opsi_quickinstall.log`.

.The setup program provides information about errors and logfiles.
