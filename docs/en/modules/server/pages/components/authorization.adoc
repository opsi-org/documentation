[[server-components-authorization]]
= Authorizations

This chapter focuses on user and group administration for the opsi server. You will learn about the default accounts and groups with administrative privileges and the process of creating custom accounts to manage the opsi server. Additionally, the chapter provides guidance on integrating an opsi server into a Windows domain, utilizing a directory service for authentication, and implementing two-factor authentication for enhanced server security.

[[server-components-authorization-users-and-groups]]
== Users and Groups

opsi uses the following user and group accounts:

* `opsiconfd`: This account is for the system service `opsiconfd` (detailed in chapter xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc[*opsiconfd* Service]). The account must be a member of the `opsiadmin` and `opsifileadmins` groups.
* `pcpatch`: An account used by opsi clients for CIFS (Samba) access to the opsi depot. It must be a member of the `opsifileadmins` group (refer to section <<server-components-authorization-pcpatch-password>>).

NOTE: To manage local users and groups on the opsi server, employ standard Linux tools such as `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd`, `groupmod`, etc. (see section <<server-components-authorization-create-local-users>>). Alternatively, you can connect the opsi config server to an existing Windows domain (see section <<server-components-authorization-domain-join>>) or to LDAP/Active Directory (see section <<server-components-authorization-ldap-authentication>>).

opsi uses specific groups to manage authorizations:

* `opsiadmin`: Members of this group have administrative access to the opsi service. This means they are granted full access via various interfaces, including the management interface `opsi-configed`, the opsi WebGUI, and the `opsiconfd` admin page.
* `opsifileadmins`: Members of this group have administrative access to opsi files (i.e. the depot, repository, and workbench).
* `opsireadonly`: Members of this group are provided with read-only access to the opsi service.

The names of these groups can be modified in the configuration file `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf`, specifically within the `groups` section:

// cSpell:disable
[source,toml]
----
[groups]
fileadmingroup = "opsifileadmins"
admingroup = "opsiadmin"
readonly = "opsireadonlys"
----
// cSpell:enable

[[server-components-authorization-pcpatch-password]]
=== Password for User *pcpatch*

Since opsi clients use this account for authentication, the opsi config server needs to be aware of the password. To ensure security, the password is stored in an encrypted format in the file `/etc/opsi/passwd`. Upon the installation of an opsi config server, a random password is automatically generated, which typically does not require modification.

However, if you need to change the password, you can do so using the command line tool `opsi-admin`. For more information on how to use this tool, refer to the section xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-admin[*opsi-admin*]:

[source,console]
----
opsi-admin task setPcpatchPassword
----

After pressing the [Enter] button, you will be prompted to enter the new password.

NOTE: This action will change the password for both the local Unix and Samba account. If it concerns a domain account, you will also need to manually reset the new password within the domain settings.

[[server-components-authorization-create-local-users]]
=== Creating an Admin Account

To create local users and groups on the opsi config server, you should use the standard Linux tools. For instance, to set up a new user named `adminuser` and grant them full administrative access to the opsi server, you would add them to the `opsiadmin` and `opsifileadmins` groups.

TIP: The `adminuser` account already exists in the preconfigured virtual machine and in our Docker container. However, you can follow these steps to add more accounts.

Begin by creating the new account with the `useradd` command:

[source,console]
----
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash adminuser
----

Then set a Unix password (system) for the new account:

[source,console]
----
sudo passwd adminuser
----

If the user is also to have file access via CIFS (Samba), set a password for this as well:

[source,console]
----
sudo smbpasswd -a adminuser
----

CAUTION: Do not use the *§* character in passwords!

Next, add the new user to the `opsiadmin` and `opsifileadmins` groups:

[source,console]
----
usermod -aG opsiadmin adminuser opsifileadmins
----

Enter the command `id` to check that the account `adminuser` exists and belongs to both groups:

[source,console]
----
id adminuser
# uid=1000(adminuser) gid=1000(opsiadmin) groups=1000(opsiadmin),999(opsifileadmins)
----

[[server-components-authorization-domain-join]]
== Including opsi Server in Windows Domain

For an opsi server to work within a Windows or Samba 4 domain environment, as opposed to using local Unix and Samba accounts, the `opsiadmin` and `opsifileadmins` groups should be created within the domain.

TIP: If you wish to use different names for these groups or use existing domain groups, modify the group names in the `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf` configuration file accordingly.

Additionally, create a domain user `pcpatch` as a member of the `opsifileadmins` group, and `opsiconfd` as a member of both `opsiadmin` and `opsifileadmins` groups.

Next, remove the `opsiadmin` and `opsifileadmins` groups from the local Unix system using the `groupdel` command. Also, delete the local Unix accounts `opsiconfd` and `pcpatch` using the `userdel` command.

Proceed to add the opsi server to the Windows domain. The specific steps for this process vary and should be referenced from the documentation of the Linux distribution in use.

Once the server is joined to the domain, execute the following two commands:

[source,console]
----
opsiconfd setup
opsi-set-rights
----

NOTE: For more information on the two commands, see the two sections xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc#server-components-opsiconfd-setup[*opsiconfd setup* Command] and xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-set-rights[*opsi-set-rights*].

Finally, reset the password for the user `pcpatch` (see section <<server-components-authorization-pcpatch-password>>).

[[server-components-authorization-ldap-authentication]]
== Authentication against Directory Service

By default, opsi employs PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) for authentication across various services and applications. This method is compatible with both local users and groups, as well as with opsi servers integrated into a domain. Alternatively, directory services such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or AD (Active Directory) can be used. These directory services centralize user accounts, groups, and other identity information, facilitating authentication and authorization across different services and applications.

NOTE: Samba authentication operates separately from this system. Therefore, the approach detailed in this section is particularly relevant for opsi environments where administrators access opsi shares via WebDAV instead of Samba, which is commonly the case with opsi servers running in Docker.

TIP: To use an LDAP server or an Active Directory for authentication instead of PAM, the xref:opsi-modules:modules.adoc[opsi extension] *opsi directory connector* is required.

=== Configuration

Configuration for connecting opsi to AD/Samba 4 or LDAP is done through the `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf` file, specifically in the `[ldap_auth]` section. In both scenarios—whether integrating with AD/Samba 4 or LDAP—you need to specify the address of the directory service using the `ldap_url` parameter. The URL should be structured as follows:

[source,toml]
----
ldap[s]://<Adresse-des-LDAP-Servers>[:port]/<base-dn>
----

In addition to specifying the LDAP/AD address, you can set the username for authentication using the `username` option in the configuration file. This option allows the use of placeholders such as `\{username\}` and `\{base\}`. Generally, providing the `ldap_url` is sufficient for most setups.

Here's an example for connecting to an Active Directory or Samba 4:

[source,toml]
----
[ldap_auth]
ldap_url = "ldaps://ad.company.de/dc=ad,dc=company,dc=de"
----

Example for connecting to an OpenLDAP service:

[source,toml]
----
[ldap_auth]
ldap_url = "ldaps://ldap.company.org:636/dc=company,dc=org"
username = "uid={username},dc=Users,{base}"
----

Once you have made and saved the necessary changes in the configuration file, you should restart the xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc[*opsiconfd*] service to apply these changes.

NOTE: It's important to ensure that the group specified after `admingroup` in the `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf` file also exists in the directory service.

[[server-components-authorization-multi-factor]]
== Two-factor authentication

The opsi server supports two-factor authentication and uses the TOTP algorithm for this purpose. Time-based One-time Password is a standard procedure for two-factor authentication (2FA) in which a one-time password is generated. This consists of six digits and is also required to log in to the opsi server.

NOTE: To set up two-factor authentication, you need the xref:opsi-modules:modules.adoc[opsi extension] WAN/VPN.

=== General setup
// cSpell:ignore multi-factor-auth, inactive, totp_optional, totp_mandatory

To activate two-factor authentication, configure the `opsiconfd` service accordingly (see section xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc#server-components-opsiconfd-config[Configuration]). Customize the configuration file `/etc/opsi/opsiconfd.conf` and define one of the following values after the `multi-factor-auth` option:

* `inactive`: Two-factor authentication is inactive (default). This also applies to users with configured TOTP.
* `totp_optional`: Two-factor authentication via TOTP is optional. Users with TOTP enabled must use it.
* `totp_mandatory`: TOTP is mandatory. Users without TOTP enabled will no longer be able to log in.

NOTE: After you have added your changes, call the command `opsiconfd reload`.
 
=== User-specific setup

The setup is carried out via the _Users_ tab of the xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc#server-components-opsiconfd-admin-page[opsiconfd admin page]. Click on the button _Generate new secret and activate TOTP_ to generate a secret on the server side and activate two-factor authentication for the respective user. 

You can then scan the displayed QR code with an app such as *2FA Authenticator (2FAS)* (Android and iOS). The app then generates a new one-time password every 30 seconds, which the user must then append to the normal password during authentication.

You can set up two-factor authentication on the _Users_ tab.

image::opsiconfd/opsiconfd-admin-users.png["You can set up two-factor authentication on the _Users_ tab.", pdfwidth=80%]

NOTE: If you click on the button _Generate new secret and activate TOTP_ again, you will generate a new secret. The user's previous QR code will no longer be valid.

To deactivate two-factor authentication for an account, click on _Deactivate MFA_.
