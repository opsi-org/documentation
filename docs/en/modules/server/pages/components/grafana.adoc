[[server-components-grafana]]
= Grafana

The Grafana web application specializes in visualizing data from various sources, displaying it through browser-based dashboards. Since the release of opsi 4.2, the Grafana server has been used to present performance metrics of the `opsiconfd` service. You can access the Grafana dashboard through the xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc#server-components-opsiconfd-admin-page[Admin Page], under the _Grafana_ tab. When you click on this tab, the _opsiconfd main dashboard_ is either created or updated on the Grafana server. Additionally, the user `opsidashboard` is generated for dashboard access.

The default time range displayed is _Last 5 minutes_, but you have the option to customize this view. To do so, click on the time range field in the top right-hand corner of the dashboard. A menu will appear, allowing you to set either an absolute time period (using the _From_ and _To_ fields) or a relative time period starting from the current time (options like _Last 5 minutes_, _Last 15 minutes_, etc.). After making your selection, click on _Apply time range_ to update the display.

NOTE: Grafana is not required on opsi depot servers. For these servers, it is recommended to install either the `opsi-server` or `opsi-server-expert` packages instead of the `opsi-server-full` package. Neither `opsi-server` nor `opsi-server-expert` includes Grafana as a dependency.

[[server-components-grafana-config]]
== Configuration

The `opsiconfd` service connects to the central Grafana instance using the URL `http://<api-key>@grafana:3000`. This configuration is specified in the file `/etc/opsi/opsiconfd.conf`:

[source,toml]
----
grafana-internal-url = http://opsiconfd:SbihIuvo@localhost:3000
----

To connect an external Grafana instance, specify it using the `--grafana-external-url` parameter. As illustrated in the previous example, you can include the access credentials for Grafana directly in the URL.

TIP: If you make changes to the `opsiconfd` configuration, you can apply these changes by executing the command `sudo opsiconfd reload`. For more detailed information on configuring the service, refer to the chapter xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc[*opsiconfd* Service].
