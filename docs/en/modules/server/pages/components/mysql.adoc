[[server-components-mysql]]
= MySQL Server

The opsi config server requires access to a MySQL server. If the MySQL server is hosted on the same machine, the configuration is typically automated through `opsiconfd setup` (refer to the section xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc#server-components-opsiconfd-setup[The *opsiconfd setup* Command]). `opsiconfd setup` also takes care of database migrations and clean-up tasks.

In cases where automatic configuration is unsuccessful, or if you opt to use an external MySQL server, manual configuration is required. This can be done using the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsiconfd setup --configure-mysql
----

During the process, you will be interactively prompted for the MySQL connection details. The tool then proceeds to create the opsi database on the MySQL server and establishes a user account for access.

== Configuration File
 
As an alternative, you can manually edit the MySQL configuration by modifying the file `/etc/opsi/backends/mysql.conf` using a text editor. After saving your changes, run the command `sudo opsiconfd setup` to create or update the opsi database on the MySQL server.

.You can also edit the MySQL configuration with a text editor.
