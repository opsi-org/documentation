= Important Notes

opsi 4.3, being a major release, has dedicated repositories. To upgrade, you need to add these new package sources to the respective configuration files on your systems and remove the repositories from the previous version. 

Ensure that all installed packages are updated to the latest opsi 4.2 version before proceeding with the upgrade to 4.3. Also, update other packages (such as the MySQL server), as outdated versions could hinder the upgrade process.

IMPORTANT: Prior to upgrading, make sure to update the `opsi-script`, `opsi-client-agent`, `opsi-linux-client-agent`, and `opsi-mac-client-agent` packages on all clients!

== opsi Linux Boot Image and DHCP Server

In the opsi Linux boot image for version 4.3, the bootloaders are now located in the path `<TFTP-ROOT>/opsi/opsi-linux-bootimage/loader`. *If you are using Netboot/PXE, you may need to manually adjust the DHCP server configuration, specifically option 67 (BootFile Name), to reflect these changes.*

* Legacy BIOS: `opsi/opsi-linux-bootimage/loader/opsi-netboot.bios`
* UEFI-BIOS: `opsi/opsi-linux-bootimage/loader/shimx64.efi.signed`

== Update OS Packages

Make sure you are using the most recent opsi 4.2 packages from the stable branch at the time of the upgrade!

== Update opsi Packages

opsi packages are typically compatible with both opsi 4.2 and opsi 4.3.

The official link:https://opsipackages.43.opsi.org[4.3 repositories] contain packages compatible with opsi 4.3.

NOTE: Please note that the packages in these repositories may not always include `4.3` in their version names, yet they are still compatible with opsi 4.3.

== Backend Extensions

The extension methods that were once located in `/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d` are now permanently integrated into `opsiconfd`. As a result, the `/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d` directory will be empty by default. The default files that were previously included will be relocated during the upgrade process.

However, the extend mechanism remains available for use. You can implement your own methods in custom `.conf` files placed in the `/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d` directory.

== Workbench, Depot, and Repository

With the update to opsi 4.3, fixed directories for the workbench, depot, and repository are now used under the `/var/lib/opsi` path. This new structure means that dynamic configurations set through `depotLocalUrl`, `repositoryLocalUrl`, and `workbenchLocalUrl` at the depots will no longer be recognized.

If your workbench, depot, and repository directories are currently situated in different locations, you should relocate them to `/var/lib/opsi`. Alternatively, instead of physically moving these directories, you can create symbolic links (symlinks) that point to their new location under `/var/lib/opsi`.

== Sorting Algorithm

In opsi 4.3, there is a single, new sorting algorithm for product actions, eliminating the previous distinction between `algorithm1` and `algorithm2`. This updated algorithm generally yields results comparable to those produced by the former `algorithm1`.

== opsi Packages

The new opsi packages are now located at https://opsipackages.43.opsi.org/.

== opsi Tools

The tools `opsi-configed`, `opsi-setup-detector-setup`, the WebGUI, and others are now accessible at https://tools.43.opsi.org/](https://tools.43.opsi.org/.


== *opsi-configed*

The actions available for products in the context menu (accessed by right-clicking on a product) have undergone revisions. The options _Save and execute_ and _Save and execute (selected products only)_ now take into account the configuration setting `opsiclientd.control_server.process_actions_even`.

The configuration can have the following values:

- `auto`: Triggers `timer` event in WAN mode, otherwise `on_demand` (default).
- `on_demand`: The `on_demand` event is always triggered.
- `timer`: The `timer` event is always triggered.

In opsi 4.3 it is no longer necessary to differentiate between UEFI and Legacy, as the GRUB2 bootloader is used in each case.
The UEFI hook is therefore not required for switching. 
After an OS installation via opsi, the tick indicates whether the system was installed via UEFI or legacy.
The configuration value `clientconfig.uefibootlabel` is decisive for this.
