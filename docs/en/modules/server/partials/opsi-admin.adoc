The `opsi-admin` command line tool allows you to interact with the opsi API. It offers both an interactive mode (`-i`) and a non-interactive mode, suitable for scripting purposes.

NOTE: Please also refer to the section on <<server-components-opsi-cli>> regarding `opsi-cli`. This tool is newer, more robust, and versatile, providing functionalities similar to `opsi-admin`. Since version 4.2.0.187, `opsi-cli` has been included in the `opsi-utils` package and is available on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

When using `opsi-admin` to access the opsi API, specify the service URL (`--address`), a username (`--username`), and the corresponding password (`--password`). If you don't provide a service URL, `opsi-admin` defaults to the one specified in `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf`. If the username and password are not included in the command, authentication will occur using the host ID and the cost key from `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf`.

TIP: You can store the access data in a personal configuration file (see section <<server-components-opsi-admin-opsirc>>).

.Call `opsi-admin -i` to start the tool in interactive mode.

When you launch `opsi-admin` with the `-c` parameter, it enables a color-coded display. The complete command for this mode is `opsi-admin -ic`. While in interactive mode, you can use the [Tab] key for auto-completing commands. Additionally, `opsi-admin` maintains a history of previously entered commands, which you can navigate through using the arrow keys.

For script-friendly output, `opsi-admin` offers `-s` (shell output) and `-S` (simple output).

To execute RPC methods of the API, use the command `method <method_name>`. For executing more complex administrative tasks, the command `task <taskname>` is appropriate. For further examples and detailed usage of `opsi-admin`, please refer to the section <<server-components-opsi-admin-examples>>.

=== Configuration File

You can save your access credentials for the opsi web service in a configuration file. This setup allows you to establish a connection without having to input your username and password every time you use the command line.

The file is named `opsirc` and is located in the hidden folder `~/.opsi.org` in the user's home directory. The structure of this file is as follows:

[source,toml]
----
address = https://<opsi-server>:4447/rpc
username = <opsi-user>
password = <secret>
----

The information within the `opsirc` file is entirely optional. If the file is either empty or doesn't exist, `opsi-admin` will revert to using the default settings as previously mentioned.

TIP: The `--opsirc` parameter allows you to specify an alternative path to a different configuration file when executing the command. This feature enables you to prepare and use multiple configurations for various connections.

* Print a simple list of the IDs of all opsi clients: +
[source,console]
----
opsi-admin -S method host_getIdents str '{"type":"OpsiClient"}'
----
* Delete an opsi client: +
[source,console]
----
opsi-admin method host_delete <client-id>
----
* Create or overwrite an opsi client (`opsi-admin ... <client-id> <opsi-host-key> <description>`): +
[source,console]
----
opsi-admin method host_createOpsiClient client1.opsi.internal null "Test client 1"
----
* Send action request to a product (`opsi-admin ... <product-id> <client-id> <action-request>`): +
[source,console]
----
opsi-admin -d method setProductActionRequest opsi-client-agent client1.opsi.internal setup
----
* List products installed on clients: +
[source,console]
