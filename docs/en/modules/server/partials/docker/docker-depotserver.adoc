=== opsi depot server

Check the settings for network and volumes. You do not need the two services `mysql` and `grafana` for a depot server, so you can comment them out or delete them. Be sure to then also remove `mysql` from the `depends_on` attribute in the `opsi-server` section.

Set the variable `OPSI_HOST_ROLE` to `depotserver`:

[source,toml]
----
OPSI_HOST_ROLE: depotserver
----

For a depot server you also set the two variables `OPSI_SERVICE_ADDRESS` (service URL of the opsi config server) and `OPSI_HOST_KEY` (host key of the depot). Then start all services via `./opsi-server.sh start` (Linux, macOS) or `.\opsi-server.ps1 start` (Windows).

NOTE: The host key of the opsi depot server can be found in the admin interface of the opsi config server on the tab 'Depots'. There you can also create a new opsi depot server if necessary.
