=== opsi Depot Server

You can use our Docker image to set up an opsi depotserver. This assumes that an opsi configserver already exists and that it is accessible over the network. Specifically, you should verify whether the Docker host can reach the configserver on port 4447 via HTTPS (see section xref:server:components/network.adoc#server-components-network-ports[Used Protocols and Ports]). You can use `curl` on the command line for this purpose (Windows: Command Prompt, Linux/macOS: Terminal):

[source,console]
----
curl --insecure https://<fqdn>:4447/public
----

Replace `<fqdn>` with the FQDN or IP address of the opsi configserver; the `public` directory is usually accessible without authentication on the configserver. You will receive an XML file as a response.

Additionally, create a new depot on the configserver. The easiest way to do this is via the xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc#server-components-opsiconfd-admin-page[Admin Page] on the _Depots_ tab. Enter the FQDN of the Docker host and an optional description, then click on _Create depot_. The new depot should appear immediately in the list; you will need the host key for configuring the depot server.

Now you can edit the `docker-compose.yml` file in the text editor of your choice. For a depot server, you do not require the two services `mysql` and `grafana`, so you can either comment them out or delete them. It's important to also remove `mysql` from the `depends_on` attribute in the `opsi-server` section if you choose to exclude these services.

To configure the server as a depot server, set the `OPSI_HOST_ROLE` variable to `depotserver`:

[source,toml]
----
OPSI_HOST_ROLE: depotserver
----

For setting up a depot server, you also need to configure two additional variables: `OPSI_SERVICE_ADDRESS` (the service URL of the opsi config server) and `OPSI_HOST_KEY` (the host key of the depot). Once these variables are set, start all services using `./opsi-server.sh start` (Linux, macOS) or `.\opsi-server.ps1 start` (Windows).

NOTE: You can locate the host key of the opsi depot server in the admin interface of the opsi config server, specifically on the _Depots_ tab. Click on the dots to display the key.
