== The helper scripts

We have included two helper scripts to make it easier to work with the opsi-Docker container. On Linux and macOS use the script `opsi-server.sh`. First make this executable:

[source,console]
----
chmod +x opsi-server.sh
----

Then call it as a normal user without further parameters or options to display online help:


[source,console]
----
./opsi-server.sh
Usage: ./opsi-server.sh <command>

Commands:
  edit                      Edit docker-compose.yml.
  start                     Start all containers.
  status                    Show running containers.
  stop                      Stop all containers.
  logs [service]            Attach to container logs (all logs or supplied service).
  shell [service]           Exexute a shell in a running container (default service: opsi-server).
  update                    Update and restart all containers.
  open-volumes              Open volumes directory in explorer.
  inspect [service]         Show detailed container informations (default service: opsi-server).
  diff [service]            Show container's filesystem changes (default service: opsi-server).
  prune                     Delete all containers and unassociated volumes.
  export-images             Export images as archive.
  import-images [archive]   Import images from archive.
  build [--no-cache]        Build opsi-server image. Use --no-cache to build without cache.
  publish                   Publish opsi-server image.

The second script `opsi-server.ps1` is intended for Windows users and for use on Windows PowerShell. It has essentially the same options and parameters; only the last two commands (`build` and `publish`) are not available.
