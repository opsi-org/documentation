Over time, opsi has accumulated a variety of command line tools. As the `opsi-utils` and `opsi-python` scripts were developed at different times, they each possess unique structures, command line options, and output formats. While some tools interact with the standard RPC interface, others bypass the opsi web service and directly interface with the backend.

The more recent addition, `opsi-cli`, offers access to the same functionalities found in earlier tools, and even more. Additionally, `opsi-cli` features a plugin system, enabling opsi users to enhance its capabilities with custom plugins. 

[[server-components-opsi-cli-installation]]
=== Installation

Since version 4.2.0.187, `opsi-cli` has been a component of the `opsi-utils` package and is therefore automatically installed on opsi servers. As a client component, `opsi-cli` can also be used remotely from the opsi server, with all communication occurring exclusively via the opsi web service. Consequently, `opsi-cli` is available for Linux, Windows, and macOS clients.

When using `opsi-cli` outside of an opsi server, you need to provide credentials for the opsi web service. This can be done either directly in the command line with `--service`, `--username`, and `--password`, or by saving the credentials locally on the client (use `opsi-cli config service add --help` for guidance, see section <<server-components-opsi-cli-serviceoptions>>).

NOTE: On Arch Linux you need to install the `libxcrypt-compat` package for `opsi-cli` to function correctly.

`opsi-cli` is designed to be immediately executable and portable. If you wish to include the binary in the path on an opsi client, you can manage this directly through `opsi-cli` itself:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli self --help
----

image::opsi-cli-self-help.png["Ausgabe: opsi-cli self --help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

[[server-components-opsi-cli-usage]]
=== Usage

`opsi-cli` is a Python-based binary that operates based on parameters and commands. Every command within `opsi-cli` can consist of one or several subcommands. The upcoming sections will first introduce the basic functionalities and then delve into the available commands.

TIP: Each command in `opsi-cli` comes with its own online help, accessible via the `--help` parameter. For example, you can use `opsi-cli --help` or `opsi-cli config --help` to view detailed information about specific commands.

The typical structure for executing an `opsi-cli` command is as follows:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
----

Options specified immediately after the `opsi-cli` command are part of the global configuration and therefore apply to all subsequent subcommands. There are three main categories of global options in `opsi-cli`.

[[server-components-opsi-cli-globaloptions]]
==== General Options

The parameters in the `General options` section let you adjust aspects like logging, enable colored output, and configure other settings in `opsi-cli`. 

image::opsi-cli-general-options.png["Output: opsi-cli general options", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

[[server-components-opsi-cli-formatoptions]]
==== Output Format

The options found under `IO options` are used to standardize the output across all subcommands, allowing you to specify output formats and apply filters.

image::opsi-cli-io-options.png["Output: opsi-cli io options", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

The following example demonstrates how to use these options for filtering and formatting output. In the first command, `opsi-cli` executes the JSON-RPC method `host_getObjects` (`execute`) to display information about opsi clients from the domain `domain.local` with names beginning with `client`:

[source,toml]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"id":"client*.domain.local"}'
[
  {
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Created by opsi-deploy-client-agent at Mon, 26 Sep 2022 17:19:29",
    "id": "client-linux.domain.local",
    "hardwareAddress": "08:00:27:f5:1d:8e",
    "ipAddress": "192.168.56.11",
    "inventoryNumber": "",
    "systemUUID": null,
    "opsiHostKey": null,
    "created": "2022-09-26 17:19:29",
    "lastSeen": "2023-03-08 12:13:10",
    "oneTimePassword": null,
    "type": "OpsiClient",
    "ident": "client-linux.domain.local"
  },
  […]
]
----

The next command formats the output as a table in the terminal and filters it to include only three attributes: `id`, `type`, and `lastSeen`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli --output-format table --attributes id,type,lastSeen jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"id":"client*.domain.local"}'
----

image::opsi-cli-table-format.png["Tabellenformat", pdfwidth=80%, width=400]

If you prefer the CSV format, simply write `csv` after `--output-format` instead of `table`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli --output-format csv --attributes id,type,lastSeen jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"id":"client*.domain.local"}'
[…]
id;lastSeen;type
client-linux.domain.local;2023-03-08 12:13:10;OpsiClient
client-macos.domain.local;2023-03-15 14:55:37;OpsiClient
client-win10.domain.local;2023-03-15 15:13:46;OpsiClient
----

You can use the `--output-file` option to directly write the output to a file.

[[server-components-opsi-cli-serviceoptions]]
==== Service Options

When using `opsi-cli` outside of the opsi server, it's necessary to provide access credentials for the opsi web service. The relevant parameters for this are `--service`, `--username`, and `--password`:

image::opsi-cli-service-options.png["Output: opsi-cli service options", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

TIP: As an alternative, you can save the access credentials directly on the client. This approach is particularly useful if you need to access multiple opsi servers, as it allows you to create and manage different service configurations as profiles. To set this up, use the `opsi-cli config` command. For detailed instructions and options, you can view the online help by entering `opsi-cli config service add --help`.

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands]]
=== Commands and Examples

The following sections will detail the currently available commands in `opsi-cli` and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands-config]]
==== *config*

Use this command to adjust the `opsi-cli` configuration:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli config --help
----

image::opsi-cli-config-help.png["Ausgabe: opsi-cli config --help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

Use the following command to view the current configuration and the default settings:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli config list
----

image::opsi-cli-config-list.png["Output: opsi-cli config list", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

To permanently modify a configuration value, use the command `opsi-cli config set <name> <value>`. This adjustment will then be applied to all future uses of `opsi-cli`. If you need to remove a previously set value, use the command `opsi-cli config unset <name>`. For managing service access configurations, `opsi-cli config service` provides several subcommands, including `add`, `list`, and `remove`.

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands-jsonrpc]]
==== *jsonrpc*

The `jsonrpc` command in `opsi-cli` provides access to JSON-RPC methods, allowing their execution on the opsi server. This functionality enables `opsi-cli` to fully replace the `opsi-admin` tool. The `jsonrpc` command includes two subcommands:

* `opsi-cli jsonrpc methods`: This command prints a list of all available API methods along with their parameters.
* `opsi-cli jsonrpc execute <method>`: Use this command to execute a specified method.

The output of `opsi-cli jsonrpc methods` also indicates if a method is marked as obsolete in the `deprecated` column, while the `alternative_method` column shows the recommended alternative method.

To execute a specific method, append its name after the `opsi-cli jsonrpc execute` command, for example:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute authenticated
----

The syntax for using `opsi-cli` is similar to that of `opsi-admin`, as can be seen in a direct comparison:

[source,console]
----
opsi-admin method authenticated
----

The way in which method parameters are specified in `opsi-cli` is exactly the same as in `opsi-admin`, as illustrated by the following, slightly more complex example:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects '["created","lastSeen"]' '{"id":"testclient01.uib.local"}'
----

Old variant:

[source,console]
----
opsi-admin method host_getObjects '["created","lastSeen"]' '{"id":"testclient01.uib.local"}'
----

NOTE: In the two examples provided, the `-d` parameter for `opsi-admin` (which bypasses `opsiconfd`) is intentionally omitted. Bypassing the opsi web service in the past, has occasionally led to issues within the opsi system. Therefore, access to the API is recommended solely via the opsi web service. It's important to note that `opsi-cli` does not support bypassing `opsiconfd`.

When operating directly on the opsi server, there's no need to input any access credentials, as `opsi-cli` automatically retrieves this information from the server configuration. However, if you plan to use `opsi-cli` in scripts, cronjobs, or similar automated tasks, it's essential to set up the access data in advance.

The output format for `jsonrpc` commands in `opsi-cli` can also be adjusted using parameters like `--output-format` and `--attributes`, similar to other `opsi-cli` commands. For more details on formatting options, please refer to the section <<server-components-opsi-cli-formatoptions>>.

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli --output-format table --attributes id,created,lastSeen jsonrpc execute host_getObjects '["created","lastSeen"]' '{"id":"testclient01.uib.local"}'
----

NOTE: When using `opsi-cli` on Windows, be aware that the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) and PowerShell interpret single and double quotation marks differently. Therefore, it might be necessary to use escape sequences to ensure the commands work correctly.

The following examples demonstrate how to list all depots in an opsi environment, highlighting the differences between commands on Linux/macOS and Windows. Here is how the command is executed on Linux and macOS:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{"type":"OpsiDepotserver"}'
----

For the Windows command prompt, the command is executed as follows:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] {\"type\":\"OpsiDepotserver\"}
----

In PowerShell (versions prior to 7), the command is formatted as follows:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_getObjects [] '{\"type\":\"OpsiDepotserver\"}'
----

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands-client-actions]]
==== *client-action*

The `client-action` command serves as a key tool in the management of opsi clients. It primarily provides a range of options to selectively target and influence the list of clients subject to various actions:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli client-action --help
----

image::opsi-cli-client-action-help.png["Output: opsi-cli client-action --help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

The `client-action` command currently includes the `set-action-request` subcommand, designed to execute actions for products on opsi clients. This subcommand is comparable to the `task` command in `opsi-admin` (refer to section <<server-components-opsi-admin-examples>> for more details). However, it operates based on the exclusion principle, implying that in the absence of specified clients and products, the action applies universally. To provide more control, `set-action-request` introduces additional options for filtering the products impacted by an action:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --help
----

image::opsi-cli-set-action-request-help.png["Output: opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

CAUTION: Executing the command without specifying clients and products will affect all clients and products. To minimize the risk of errors, `opsi-cli` restricts the execution of `set-action-request` unless at least one of the following parameters is specified: `--where-outdated`, `--where-failed`, `--products`, or `--product-groups`.

For setting all outdated products of clients to `setup`, use this command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --where-outdated
----

Alternatively, set only a specific product (here: `opsi-client-agent`) to `setup`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --clients test-98.domain.tld set-action-request --products opsi-client-agent

[5] [2022-10-28 12:54:59.998] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-98.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:55:00.055] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:55:00.065] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-98.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

The default product status is `setup`. To set the same product to `uninstall`, use the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --clients test-98.domain.tld set-action-request --products opsi-client-agent --request-type uninstall

[5] [2022-10-28 12:57:06.848] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-98.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:57:06.904] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 12:57:06.914] [               ] Setting 'uninstall' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-98.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

To reset an action request for a specific product on a client, use the switch `None` (`none` is also allowed):

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --clients test-98.domain.tld set-action-request --products opsi-client-agent --request-type None

[5] [2022-10-28 14:12:50.538] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-98.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 14:12:50.574] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 14:12:50.580] [               ] Setting 'None' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-98.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

In the event of an error with a product, it's crucial to have the capability to temporarily reverse all actions for that product on the clients. This precautionary measure helps prevent the further distribution of the faulty product:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --products opsi-client-agent --request-type None
----

Should the product become available again, error-free, at a later stage, you can reset all outdated or incorrect status information back to `setup`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli client-action set-action-request --where-outdated --where-failed
----

To set a specific product on a group of clients (here: `testclients`) to `setup`, type this:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --client-groups testclients set-action-request --products opsi-client-agent

[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.100] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-1.domain.tld', 'test-2.domain.tld', 'test-3.domain.tld', 'test-4.domain.tld', 'test-5.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.159] [               ] Handling products ['opsi-client-agent']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.169] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-1.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.170] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-2.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.170] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-3.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.170] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-4.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:03:24.170] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-5.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
----

Beyond specifying a group of clients, you have the option to define a group of products (in this example: `testproducts`) using the `--product-groups` parameter:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli -l5 client-action --client-groups testclients set-action-request --product-groups testproducts

[5] [2022-10-28 13:05:53.147] [               ] Selected clients: ['test-1.domain.tld', 'test-2.domain.tld', 'test-3.domain.tld', 'test-4.domain.tld', 'test-5.domain.tld']   (client_action_worker.py:48)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:05:53.225] [               ] Handling products ['hwaudit', 'opsi-client-agent', 'swaudit']   (set_action_request_worker.py:105)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:05:53.236] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: hwaudit -> test-1.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)
[5] [2022-10-28 13:05:53.237] [               ] Setting 'setup' ProductActionRequest: opsi-client-agent -> test-1.domain.tld   (set_action_request_worker.py:134)

`opsi-cli` automatically omits a specified list of packages when using the `--where-outdated` and `--where-failed` parameters. Currently, these packages include `opsi-winst`, `opsi-auto-update`, `opsi-script`, `shutdownwanted`, `windows10-upgrade`, `activate-win`, `opsi-script-test`, `opsi-bootimage-local`, `opsi-uefi-netboot`, `opsi-wan-config-on`, `opsi-wan-config-off`, `opsi-winpe`, `win10-sysprep-app-update-blocker`, and `windomain`.

TIP: While it's straightforward to exclude additional products or product groups, a safer approach is to maintain a separate product group and specify this group during execution. This strategy enables you to limit changes exclusively to this group.

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands-plugin]]
==== *plugin*

All `opsi-cli` commands, including the `plugin` command, are implemented as plugins. The `plugin` command is used for plugin management, such as installing new external plugins or removing active plugins from the system. Additionally, `opsi-cli plugin` can be used to list or export plugins.

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli plugin --help
----

image::opsi-cli-plugin-help.png["Output: opsi-cli plugin --help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

To generate a template for a new plugin:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli plugin new
----

After you have entered the name, version, and description, `opsi-cli` creates a new directory using the specified name. This directory includes the subdirectories `python` and `data`:

* The `python` directory is intended for the code of the new plugin. It is structured as a Python package and includes a `__init__.py` file to get started. Inside, you will find an example of a command, a subcommand, and some options.

* The `data` directory is for static resources related to the plugin; it is typically not necessary to modify this directory.

Once you have populated the template with content, proceed to add the plugin to the running `opsi-cli` instance:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli plugin add <directory>
----

If the specified directory contains valid Python code, the command within it becomes available as a plugin in `opsi-cli`.

TIP: To display all registered plugins, use the command `opsi-cli plugin list`.

You can export a plugin to an archive and then import it into another `opsi-cli` instance:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli plugin export <name>
opsi-cli plugin add <archive>
----

Use these commands to convert a directory into an archive and vice versa:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli plugin compress <directory>
opsi-cli plugin extract <archive>
----

NOTE: To modify an imported plugin, first unpack it using the `extract` command, then alter the contents of the directory, and finally call `opsi-cli plugin add <directory>` again. This process will replace the existing plugin with the updated version that shares the same name.

To remove a plugin from an `opsi-cli` instance, use the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli plugin remove <name>
----

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands-self]]
==== *self*

Use the `self` command to manage the `opsi-cli` instance. This includes installing or uninstalling `opsi-cli` on the system, activating autocomplete, and displaying the command structure.

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli self --help
----

image::opsi-cli-self-help.png["Output: opsi-cli self --help", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

You can install `opsi-cli` on your system using the `opsi-cli` binary. Execute the command `opsi-cli self install` for this purpose. During the installation process, the binary program is copied to a globally accessible location (or included in the PATH on Windows), and a configuration file is generated. You have the option to choose between a user-specific installation or a system-wide installation with the `--system` option. To uninstall, use the command `opsi-cli self uninstall`.

TIP: If you install the opsi package `opsi-cli` or `opsi-utils` on a client, you can skip the step `opsi-cli self install`.

To view the command structure, including all commands, their version numbers, and subcommands, enter `opsi-cli self command-structure`.

The `opsi-cli` autocompletion works for commands, subcommands and options. To set it up, enter this command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli self setup-shell-completion
----

The autocompletion feature is currently compatible with three different shells: Bash, ZSH, and Fish. Once you restart the active shell or log in anew, tab completion can be used in the same manner as in conventional Unix shells. Press [Tab] [Tab] to display all available options or commands, depending on the context. Here's how [Tab] [Tab] functions in various scenarios:

* When used after `opsi-cli` or any command with at least one subcommand, it presents a list of available (sub)commands.
* After entering `-`, it shows the available options for the current command or for `opsi-cli` itself.
* Following a subcommand, it reveals possible values for the arguments:
    - For the subcommands `set`, `show`, and `unset` of `opsi-cli config`, [Tab] [Tab] generates a list of all available configurations that can be modified.
    - For `opsi-cli jsonrpc execute`, it displays a list of available methods, which can be filtered by a specified prefix.

==== *support*

The `opsi-cli support` command is designed to assist in diagnosing and resolving issues within your opsi environment. Currently, it includes a single subcommand: `opsi-cli support health-check`. This command examines various factors that might affect the efficient operation of an opsi environment and compiles a comprehensive report.

The example below provides a concise overview of the report. Without limiting the attributes (`--attributes=id,status,message`), it delivers more extensive details on the warnings (`warnings`) and error messages (`errors`):

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli --attributes=id,status,message support health-check
----

[[server-components-opsi-cli-commands-terminal]]
==== *terminal*

The `opsi-cli terminal` command launches a simple terminal client, allowing you to connect to opsi servers, functioning similarly to SSH or PuTTY. To access a particular opsi server, you should enter either the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or the opsi host ID.

Additionally, this command can be used to communicate with the opsi config server:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli terminal configserver
----

As soon as you close the terminal (command `exit` or key combination [Ctrl]{plus}[D]), the connection is terminated.
