TIP: Instead of the `opsi-server-full` package, you can also install `opsi-server` or `opsi-server-expert`. These packages have different dependencies and are intended for cases where you want to run MySQL, Redis or Grafana on a different server. `opsi-server` and `opsi-server-expert` offer more flexibility, but should only be used by experienced Linux administrators.

NOTE: Make sure that your firewall and the SELinux configuration allow connections to ports 69/UDP (TFTP) and 4447/TCP and 4441/TCP (opsi).
