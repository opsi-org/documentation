The command line tool `opsi-package-updater` is designed for downloading opsi products from one or more repositories and installing them on the opsi depot server. Its primary function is to automate the updating of opsi packages on a scheduled basis, e.g. through a cronjob.

NOTE: Repositories are defined as sources providing opsi packages for download. You can configure each repository individually, customizing access and behavior.

To access the online help, enter the command `opsi-package-updater --help`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater --help
usage: opsi-package-updater [-h] [--version] [--config CONFIGFILE]
                            [--verbose | --log-level {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}]
                            [--force-checksum-calculation] [--repo repository_name]
                            [--use-inactive-repository] [--ignore-errors] [--no-zsync]
                            {install,update,download,list} ...

Updater for local opsi products. Operates in different MODEs: install, update, download and list. Each
mode has their own options that can be viewed with MODE -h
[â€¦]
----

The `--repo` parameter allows you to limit operations to a specific repository.

`opsi-package-updater` supports the following commands:

* `list`: Displays a list of available repositories or opsi packages.
* `download`: Downloads opsi packages from a repository.
* `install`: Downloads and installs opsi packages from a repository.
* `update`: Updates locally installed opsi packages from the repositories.

Each command has its own detailed help information, which you can access by entering `opsi-package-updater <command> --help`.

TIP: To get more detailed output, use the `-v` (verbose) parameter. This switch can be used multiple times for increased verbosity (`-vvv`, `-vvvv`, etc.).

=== Examples

To display the activated repositories:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater list --active-repos
----

To list the packages available in the repositories:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater list --products
----

To install the package `ubuntu` from the repository `uib_linux`, with `-vv` providing a very detailed output:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater -vv --repo uib_linux install ubuntu
----

To download and install all packages available in the activated repositories:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater install
----

To display the available updates:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater list --updatable-products
----

To update the locally installed packages `firefox` and `javavm` from the repositories; `-vv` produces detailed output:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater -vv update firefox javavm
----

=== Repositories

The general settings for the `opsi-package-updater` are located in the file `/etc/opsi/opsi-package-updater.conf`. This file includes various sections that specify settings such as the location of the opsi packages (`packageDir`), the name of the log file (`logFile`), and the directory for the repositories (`repositoryConfigDir`). Additionally, settings for e-mail notifications and Wake on LAN (WoL) for clients are also configured here.

The configuration files for individual repositories are located in the directory `/etc/opsi/package-updater.repos.d/`. Within this directory, you'll find a commented template (file `example.repo.template`) that lists and explains all the available options.

There are two types of repositories that can be configured: internet repositories and opsi server repositories.

==== Internet Repositories

Internet repositories are defined by the following parameters:

* `baseURL`: This is the URL of the repository, for example, `http://opsipackages.43.opsi.org/stable`.
* `dirs`: A comma-separated list of directories within the repository, such as `opsi4.3/products/localboot, opsi4.3/products/netboot`.
* `username` and `password`: These are used for repositories that require authentication.
* `authcertfile` and `authkeyfile`: These parameters are for certificate-based authentication.
* `verifyCert`: This option enables or disables the verification of the server certificate for HTTPS connections.
* `proxy`: This is used to specify a proxy server.

NOTE: You can set up a proxy server for each individual repository using the `proxy` option. Alternatively, the proxy server details can be entered in the global configuration file `/etc/opsi/opsi-package-updater.conf`.

==== opsi Server Repositories

If you specify the host ID of another opsi server following `opsiDepotId` in the repository configuration file, it defines an opsi server repository. For an opsi depot server, the central opsi config server is located at this address. This setup indicates that the depot server acquires packages from the `/var/lib/opsi/repository` repository on the config server.

[[server-components-opsi-package-updater-actions]]
==== Repository Behavior

You can configure specific behaviors for each repository:

* `autoupdate`: Automatically downloads and installs more recent versions of already installed packages.
* `autoinstall`: Automatically downloads and installs available packages that are not yet installed locally.
* `autosetup`: Sets newly installed and updated packages to `setup` for all clients on which these packages are installed.
* `onlyDownload`: Only downloads new packages without installing them.
* `ignoreErrors`: Continues the process even if errors occur with individual packages, preventing the termination of the entire operation.

TIP: The `onlyDownload` option is frequently used in combination with activated notifications. This setup enables automatic email notification after new packages are downloaded, allowing an administrator to oversee the actual installation.

=== Install standard products

To install the opsi standard products from the uib repositories, use the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater -v install
----

The command updates all existing opsi packages including the templates for operating system installations from the opsi repositories.

.Install the standard products on your opsi server.

TIP: If you're using the preconfigured virtual machine, you can simply double-click the desktop icon to install the standard products.
