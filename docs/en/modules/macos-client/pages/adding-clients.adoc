= Integration of existing MacOS clients into opsi.

To include existing MacOS clients in opsi, the {opsi-client-agent} must be installed on them.
This can be performed in several ways.
After you have installed the {opsi-client-agent}, as described below, the client will also appear in the client list of the {opsi-configed}, in the case you had not already added it there previously.


Basically, is possible to <<opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup,run on the client>> or <<opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,from the server>> to trigger the installation of the agent.

Running the installation directly on the client is appropriate for individual machines.
For a mass deployment of the agent, the <<opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,opsi-deploy-client-agent>> is generally more suitable.
If the necessary unlocks are available on the Mac clients.

If there is already another way to deploy software, it's also possible to deploy the opsi-client-agent and run the `silent_setup.sh` script included in the package.

Once the agent is installed, existing opsi products can be xref:rollout-products.adoc#opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests[installed] on these clients.

== Using service_setup.sh on macOS


[[opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup1]]
=== Using service_setup.sh on macOS (initial installation).

Due to MacOS security restrictions, the ability to run scripts from mounted shares is limited. Trying to do the following with a share mounted via `Finder` to `/Volumes` (or similar) will therefore fail (depending on the MacOS version).

* Log in to the client.
* Start the terminal program
* For the following commands you need to replace the following placeholders:
** `<username>` with your login name.
** `<mnt>` with a directory name that does not exist yet e.g. 'mnt'.
** `<serviceuser>` with a username that is known on the opsi-server.
** `<servicepass>` with the password of the <serviceuser>. You can also omit `:<servicepass>` together with the mount option `-N`, then you will be prompt to input the password
** `<opsi-server>` the name or IP number of the opsi-server.

[source,prompt]
----
sudo su
cd /Users/<username>
mkdir <mnt>
mount_smbfs //<serviceuser>@<opsi-server>/opsi_depot /Users/<username>/<mnt>
cd /Users/<username>/<mnt>/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /Users/<username>/<mnt>
----

without password query

[source,prompt]
----
sudo su
cd /Users/<username>
mkdir <mnt>
mount_smbfs -N //<serviceuser>:<servicepass>@<opsi-server>/opsi_depot /Users/<username>/<mnt>
cd /Users/<username>/<mnt>/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /Users/<username>/<mnt>
----

Example:

[source,prompt]
----
sudo su
cd /Users/uib
mkdir mnt
mount_smbfs  //adminuser@sepia/opsi_depot /Users/uib/mnt
cd /Users/uib/mnt/opsi-mac-client-agent
./service_setup.sh
cd
umount /Users/uib/mnt
----

. Start from the mounted share the script `opsi-mac-client-agent\service_setup.sh` +.
Confirm with 2 x Enter
. The script copies the necessary files into a temporary local directory and then starts opsi-script for the actual installation.
. The script contacts the server via opsi webservice to create the client on the server side and to find out the pckey. This is done first with the user/password combination entered in config.ini. If this fails, a login window appears with service URL ({opsi-configserver}), user name and password. Here is needed a user whom is a member of the group 'opsiadmin'. It is possible to also operate with a user which is only allowed to execute the method `host_createOpsiClient`.

CAUTION: The client reboots after the installation.

[[opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-service-setup2]]
=== Using service_setup.sh on macOS (repair installation).

* Log in to the client.
* Start the terminal program
* For the following commands you need to replace the following placeholders:
** `<serviceuser>` with a username known on the opsi-server.
** `<servicepass>` with the password of the <serviceuser>. You can also omit `:<servicepass>`, then you will be asked for the password
** `<opsi-server>` with the name or IP number of the opsi server.
* During the first installation opsi created a hidden pseudo user named opsisetupadmin, in whose `home directory` `/var/opsisetupadmin` is also the mount directory.

The reboot is *not* triggered automatically.

[[opsi-macclient-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy]]
== Using opsi-deploy-client-agent for macOS.

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script deploys the {opsi-client-agent} directly from the {opsi-server} to the clients.
It's easy to integrate a large number of clients from the server into an opsi environment.
As a prerequisite for the clients is needed:

* an activated ssh access

Unfortunately on MacOS the ssh accesses are deactivated by default.
To use the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` command these accesses must be first activated.

This can be performed interactively in the 'System preferences / sharing':

image::macos_sharing_ssh_login.png["Activating ssh access",width=300]

On the command line, this can be done as follows:

[source,prompt]
----
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
----

A checkup of the current status of the ssh access is possible with the command:

[source,prompt]
----
sudo systemsetup -getremotelogin
----

Disabling ssh access on the command line looks like this:

[source,prompt]
----
sudo launchctl unload /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist
----

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` script can be found at `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent` +
Run the script with 'root' privileges.
If the script is not executable, you can fix this problem with the following command: +
`opsi-set-rights /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent/opsi-deploy-client-agent`

The script creates the client on the server side, copies the installation files and configuration information, such as the pckey, to the client and starts the installation there. +
The installation runs in the background without any interaction from user and transparently.

The command `opsi-deploy-client-agent` has several call parameters. +
All following examples assume that you have switched to the root directory of the opsi-client-agent product: +

[source,prompt]
----
cd /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-mac-client-agent
----

Typical calls are:

* For a single client:

[source,prompt]
----
./opsi-deploy-client-agent -v --user=uib uib-mmini1
----

Results in the following output:

[source,ini]

Here HOSTFILE.TXT is a file with one client name (FQDN) per line. As long as the clients are not known to the opsi-server, it tries to install the `opsi-mac-client-agent` on this machine
