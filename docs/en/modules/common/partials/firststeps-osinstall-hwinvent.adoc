= Hardware Inventory (*hwinvent*)

If you've deployed the netboot product `hwinvent` on your opsi server (refer to chapter xref:clients:windows-client/minimal-products.adoc[Adding Products (opsi Server)]), you have the capability to perform a hardware inventory for all xref:clients:windows-client/adding-clients.adoc[connected opsi clients]. To do this, within the xref:clients:windows-client/opsiconfiged.adoc[Management Interface *opsi-configed*] in _Client configuration_ mode, select the opsi client you wish to inventory.

Update the database by choosing _File_ / _Reload all data_ or by clicking the icon with the two arrows on the extreme left. Next, switch to the _Netboot products_ tab. Here, scroll to the `hwinvent` product and click in the _Requested action_ column. A menu will appear; from this, select _setup_.

Notice that the fourth icon from the left will change its color from green to red. Click on this red checkmark to transmit the updated settings to the opsi server, after which the checkmark will turn green again.

Finally, (re)start the client; you can initiate a reboot by selecting _Reboot_ from the _Client_ menu. The client will then boot a Linux image via PXE (as explained in chapter xref:server:components/dhcp-server.adoc[DHCP Server/PXE Boot]), which conducts a hardware scan of the computer before executing a reboot.

TIP: It's not necessary to pre-install an operating system on the client for conducting a hardware inventory. If the client does not have an operating system installed, you will receive a notification post-hardware inventory stating that no operating system is found on the disk.

Once the hardware scan is completed, the client sends the results to the opsi server. This information can be accessed in the `opsi-configed` management interface under the _Hardware information_ tab.

NOTE: If you encounter a black screen after loading the opsi boot image, or if the network card isn't functioning properly, you can modify the start parameters for the boot image. To do this, in the `opsi-configed` management interface, open the _Host parameters_ tab (for more information, see section xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc#opsi-manual-clientagent-configuration-webservice[Host Parameters]). Then, click in the _opsi-linux-bootimage.append_ entry within the _Property value_ column. A dialog will appear, allowing you to adjust various settings.

.Start Parameters for the opsi Boot Image can be configured via Host Parameters.
