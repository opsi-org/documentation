[[firststeps-osinstall]]
= Using opsi to install Linux

This chapter describes how to install various Linux distributions on a computer without an existing operating system using opsi. Suitable client computers, whether physical or virtual, should meet the following requirements:

* 2{nbsp}GB of RAM; Ubuntu 22.04: at least 4{nbsp}GB of RAM
* Network card that supports network booting (PXE protocol capability for boot media loading via the network).

NOTE: Check the settings in the BIOS. Netboot must be activated and be at the top of the boot options so that you can install Linux via opsi.

There are basically two different ways:

* <<firststeps-osinstall-netboot-distro>>
* <<firststeps-osinstall-netboot-gen>>

[[firststeps-osinstall-netboot-distro]]
== Netboot Products (Distribution Installer)

Let's start with the installer provided by the distribution. Like with the unattended Windows installation, the Linux installer is equipped with an answer file, enabling a non-interactive installation process.

NOTE: The distribution's installer is not a standalone program that opsi directly executes. Rather, it comprises the distribution's kernel and `initrd`.

The basic OS installation, including tasks like partitioning, LVM setup, and basic software installation, is managed by the installer after initiating the opsi Linux boot image. The method of supplying installation sources varies depending on the Linux distribution or the specific opsi netboot package:

* Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu): These distributions acquire their installation sources over the network. The depot share only contains the netboot versions of the kernels and the related `initrd` files. These files, being relatively small, are included in the opsi package. There are, however, some exceptions:

  - Ubuntu 22.04 and newer: The `ubuntu22-04` package ans above expects an ISO image in the products `iso` subdirectory.
  - Linux Mint: Starting from version 4.2.0.2-1, the netboot packages expect an ISO image in the products `iso` subdirectory.

* Distributions based on SUSE and Red Hat: Users provide the installation sources and store the ISO image content in the `isocontent` subdirectory of the product on the depot share.

TIP: TIP: It's advisable to install not just the operating system, but also the xref:clients:linux-client/linux-client-agent.adoc[Linux Client Agent] for effective management of the new client with opsi.

=== Installation Process

This is what the individual steps look like during installation with the distribution's own installer and the opsi-Netboot product:

. Boot the opsi Linux boot image, which clears any existing partition tables and creates a small, temporary auxiliary partition.

. The opsi Linux boot image retrieves the distribution's `initrd` and unpacks it on the temporary partition.

. The opsi Linux boot image fetches the generic answer file, patches it (personalizes it,) and moves it to the `initrd` directory.

. The opsi Linux boot image creates some helper scripts and configuration files (e.g. for installing the client agent) and moves them to the `initrd` directory.

. The modified `initrd` directory is repackaged.

. The opsi Linux boot image boots the distribution kernel with the patched `initrd` via `kexec`.

. The system now performs an unattended installation of the target system and, upon completion, installs the `opsi-linux-client-agent`.

This method has the following advantages:

* The installation aligns precisely with the requirements of the distribution, which can be important for organizations with support contracts.

* Integrating new releases into opsi is simpler and therefore faster.

* Distributions based on SUSE and Red Hat, as well as Linux Mint and Ubuntu 22.04, are installed from sources located on the opsi server, offering a quicker and more reliable installation compared to using internet repositories.

[[firststeps-osinstall-netboot-distro-prepare]]
=== Installation Media for the installation

For distributions based on SUSE and Red Hat, as well as for Linux Mint and Ubuntu 22.04, the official installation media need to be stored on the opsi depot server. Store this data in the `iso` or `isocontent` subdirectory of the respective netboot product located in `/var/lib/opsi/depot`:

* `iso`: This directory is for an ISO image.
* `isocontent`: This directory holds the contents of an ISO image (similar to the `installfiles` directory of a Windows netboot package).

To make the contents of an ISO image available, mount the image temporarily, copy the data and the two hidden files `.treeinfo` and `.discinfo` recursively, and then unmount the ISO. For instance, for the product `sles15-5, the process would go as follows and is valid for other RPM based distributions:

[source,console]
----
mount SLE-15-SP5-Full-x86_64-GM-Media1.iso /mnt
cp -r /mnt/* /var/lib/opsi/depot/sles15-5/isocontent/
cp /mnt/.treeinfo /var/lib/opsi/depot/sles15-5/isocontent/
cp /mnt/.discinfo /var/lib/opsi/depot/sles15-5/isocontent/
umount /mnt
----

NOTE: The file `.discinfo` is not present on all distribution installation media and might be missing.

[[firststeps-osinstall-netboot-distro-generalproperties]]
=== General Properties

If you select a Netboot product in the `opsi-configed` management interface, the properties of the product will be displayed in the right-hand pane:

.Linux Netboot Product Properties (here: *debian12*)
image::netboot-debian12-properties.png["Linux Netboot Product Properties (here: *debian12*)", width=300, pdfwidth=30%]

The current Netboot products for Linux installations include the following properties:

* `architecture`: Select the architecture for the system you want to install. This also influences the boot image used. (Default: `64bit`)

* `askbeforeinst`: Should the start of the installation have to be confirmed on the client? (Default: `true`)

* `console_keymap`: Determines the keyboard layout, *not under `ubuntu22-04`*. (Default: `en` or depending on distribution)

* `language` or `locale`: Select the language to be installed (`locale`). (Default: `de DE` or depending on distribution)

* `timezone`: What's the time zone of the Linux system? (Default: `Europe/Berlin`)

* `root_password`: Sets the password for `root`. (Default: `linux123`)

* `user_name`: This is the name of the non-privileged user without `root` rights. (Default: `user`)

- Primary Directory (Domain Controller Master)
- Replica Directory Node (Domain Controller Slave)
- Backup Directory Node (Domain Controller Backup)
- Managed Node (Member Server)

TIP: To transform a UCS system into an opsi server, consider installing the `l-opsi-server` product.

In addition to the server roles just mentioned, the `ucs50` product also allows the installation of clients via a member server, with some unique aspects to consider. Beyond the properties outlined in the section <<firststeps-osinstall-netboot-distro-debian-ubuntu-mint>>, the `ucs50` product includes these specific UCS-related properties:

[[firststeps-osinstall-netboot-gen]]
== Netboot Products (Generic Installer)

The installation process diverges from the typical installation routines of the distributions themselves. Initially, the process starts with booting the opsi Linux boot image through netboot. This boot image is the same one used for installing Windows computers. Included in the boot image is a partitioning tool, which prepares the hard disk of the new client. It creates a root partition (`/`) and a swap partition (`/swap`), and then formats these partitions. Following this, the basic system gets installed, which includes network configuration and SSH, but excludes a graphical user interface.

NOTE: The installation of the basic system varies among different distributions. However, a common aspect across all of them is the use of original distribution packages for the installation.

If you like, you can install the client agent after the OS installation. It then takes care of installing and configuring additional software.

After the first boot of the Linux computer, you may need to configure additional components depending on the distribution you are using. For instance, on Red Hat-based systems, you might configure the SELinux security architecture, while on Debian-based distributions, setting up the keyboard layout could be necessary. These specific configurations are handled by the localboot product `l-os-postinst`.

[[firststeps-osinstall-netboot-generalproperties-gen]]
=== General Properties

The following properties control the Linux installations in all netboot products:

* `architecture`: Which architecture do you want to install on the system? This also influences the boot image used. (Default: `64bit`)

* `askbeforeinst`: Should the start of the installation have to be confirmed on the client? (Default: `true`)

* `system_partition_size`: What's the size of the system partition? You can specify the size as a percentage or as an absolute value (`G` = GByte). If you specify less than 100%, the remainder is used as a data partition (property `data_partion_create` must be `true`). (Default: `100%`)

* `swap_partition_size`: Specify the size of the swap partition. (Default: `2000M`)

* `data_partition_create`: If `true`, any remaining free hard disk space is used to create a data partition. (Default: `true`)

* `data_partition_preserve`: Should an existing data partition be preserved? (Default: `never`) Possible values are:
  - `always`: Abort installation if it is not possible to preserve an existing partition with the label `data` with the specified partitioning data.
  - `if_possible`: If a partition with the label `data` is found and it is not possible to obtain this partition with the specified partitioning data, the partition is deleted.
  - `never`: The entire partition table is always rewritten.

* `language`: Select the language to be installed (default: `en`)

* `console_keymap`: Select the keyboard layout. (Default: `de` or depending on distribution)

* `timezone`: What's the time zone of the new Linux system? (Default: `Europe/Berlin`)

* `root_password`: Sets the password for `root`. (Default: `linux123`)

* `user_password`: Sets the password for the `user` account. (Default: `linux123`)

* `online_repository`: Which distribution repository should be used for the installation? (*not for SLES*) (Default: depending on the distribution)

* `proxy`: If required, enter the address of the proxy server here (`\http://<ip>:<port>`). (Default: empty)

* `additional_packages`: Which additional packages should be installed? Enter the packages as a list separated by spaces. (Default: empty)

* `wget_and_execute`: Enter the URL of a file that is to be downloaded and executed after the installation is complete. (Default: empty)

* `install_opsi-client-agent`: Installs the Linux client agent at the same time. (Default: `true`)

* `release`: (*only Debian and Ubuntu*) Which release of the distribution should be installed? (Default: depending on the distribution)

* `setup_after_install`: Enter a list of opsi products that should be set to `setup` after the OS installation. (Default: `l-os-postinst`)

[[firststeps-osinstall-netboot-special-ubuntui-debian]]
=== Debian and Ubuntu

The basic system for Debian-based distributions is installed directly from the Internet using `debootstrap`.

NOTE: `debootstrap` is a tool for installing a Debian base system into a subdirectory of another system already in operation. This process doesn't need any installation media or ISO images, but it does require access to a Debian repository.

* The product is designated as having productive status.

* It is compatible with UEFI/GPT.

* There are corresponding opsi server packages available for this product. These can be installed by setting the property `install_opsi_server=true`.

[[firststeps-osinstall-linux-debproxy]]
=== Proxy for Debian Packages

To optimize bandwidth usage, consider employing a proxy with caching capabilities, such as Apt-Cacher NG. This is particularly advantageous for caching Debian packages. Itâ€™s ideal in environments where numerous computers retrieve packages from the same sources, like Debian or Ubuntu. Once a package is fetched from the Internet, it gets cached locally. Should another computer require the same package, it can access it directly from this cache, negating the need for a repeated download from the Internet.
