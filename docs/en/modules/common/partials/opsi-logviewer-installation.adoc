==== Installing *opsi-logviewer*

The `opsi-logviewer` is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS and is a component of the `opsi-configed` management interface.

The `opsi-configed` package is one of the standard opsi products and is typically pre-installed on your opsi server. If it's not already installed, you can do so with this command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater install opsi-configed
----

TIP: You can find an executable version of the management interface `opsi-configed` for Windows, Linux, and macOS on our website at link:https://tools.43.opsi.org/[opsi Tools].
