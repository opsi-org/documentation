This shows a user interface with input fields for
Client-ID, Opsi Service URL, Username and Password. The fields are pre-filled (if possible e.g. if a old opsicliend.conf is found), but you may need to add or change some of the data.

* Client-Id should be the fqdn of the Client.

* Opsi Service url should have the format https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_the_configserver>:4447.

* Username and Password should correspond
to a user of the group opsiadmin in case of a first installation. For reinstallation it is also possible to use Client-Id and pckey for authentication.

After starting the Installer by clicking the button _Install_ the installer connects to the server to register the client at the server. Afterwards the installer calls the included opsi-script to execute the setup.opsiscript of the opsi-[linux-|mac-]client-agent.
