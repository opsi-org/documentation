This method is ideal for integrating individual computers as clients in an opsi environment. Follow these steps:

. Log in to the client.
. Download the installer from your opsi config server. It is located at `\https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_the_config_server>:4447/public/opsi-client-agent/`. For Linux, the program is named `opsi-linux-client-agent-installer.run`, and for macOS, it's `opsi-mac-client-agent-installer.command`.

[start=3]
. Make the file executable: +
`chmod +x opsi-linux-client-agent-installer.run` (Linux) +
`chmod +x opsi-mac-client-agent-installer.command` (macOS)
. Execute the installer; root rights are required for both Linux and macOS: +
`sudo ./opsi-linux-client-agent-installer.run` (Linux) +
`sudo ./opsi-mac-client-agent-installer.command` (macOS)
. The installer then unpacks itself into a temporary local directory and launches the included `oca-installation-helper`.

. In the dialog box, enter the details for the client ID, the opsi service URL, the username, and the password. The fields may already be pre-filled, but ensure they are adjusted to match your environment:
* The client ID usually corresponds to the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the client.
* The opsi service URL should be formatted as `\https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_config_server>:4447`.
* For initial installations, use the username and password of an account in the `opsiadmin` group (refer to chapter xref:server:components/authorization.adoc[Authorizations]). For reinstallation, you may use the client ID and the host key.
. The installer will contact the server via the opsi web service to register the client with the server. Subsequently, it executes the `setup.opsiscript` of the client agent using the included `opsi-script`.

TIP: When running the installer, you can include parameters to automate various processes. Detailed information is available in the respective client agent chapters.
