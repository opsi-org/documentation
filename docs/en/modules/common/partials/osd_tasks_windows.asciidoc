The offered tasks for Windows:

. `Analyze single setup file and create an opsi package` +
Here, a setup file is analyzed and the entire process is run until an opsi package is created. This process is described in the next chapter.

. `Analyze two setup files (32 and 64 bit) and create an opsi package` +
The procedure is the same as in point 1 above with the following differences: +
Two setup programs for the 32 and 64 bit architectures are queried and analyzed. The product gets an additional property: `install_architecture` with the possible values: `32bitonly`, `64bitonly`, `both`, `systemspecific`.

. `Analyze single setup file` +
runs, similarly to point 1 above, only that is aborted after the analysis of the setup program.

. `Create an opsi package template` +
This point does not ask for a setup file, but creates a template similar to the opsi product `opsi-template` only that here the information from the product configuration is already taken over.
