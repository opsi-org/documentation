== Deploying Standard Products

Standard products include `opsi-configed`, the graphical xref:clients:windows-client/opsiconfiged.adoc[Management Interface]. As it's a Java application, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is provided to run Java applications. Follow these steps to roll out the product:

. In the management interface, switch to _Client configuration_ mode and select the client you wish to configure.
. If not already done, update the database either through the _File_ / _Reload all data_ menu or by clicking the icon on the far left (with the two arrows).
. Move to the _Localboot products_ tab.
. Next to the _opsi-configed_ product in the _Requested action_ column, click and choose the _setup_ option from the drop-down menu. The fourth icon from the left (the green tick) will turn red. Click on this icon to apply the settings to the opsi server.
+
.Select *setup* for the Product and confirm the Changes.

. Start or reboot the client.

After booting the client, the first things you'll notice are the `opsi-script` window and the `opsi-configed` installer.

.After you've (re)booted the Client, *opsi-configed* is installed. (here: Windows)

Once the installation is complete, the user can log in to the client. A new entry, _opsi-configed_, will now be available in the start menu.
