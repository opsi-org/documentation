=== Preparation

To create opsi packages, you will require the following tools:

* <<opsi-setup-detector-installation_osd,opsi-setup-detector>>
* <<opsi-setup-detector-installation_opb,opsi PackageBuilder>>
* <<opsi-logviewer-installation,opsi-logviewer>>

[[opsi-setup-detector-installation_osd]]
==== Installing *opsi-setup-detector*

The `opsi-setup-detector` is currently available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. You can install this program directly through opsi. It's one of the standard localboot products and is typically available on the opsi server. If it's not already installed, you can deploy the product using the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater install opsi-setup-detector
----

NOTE: The localboot product `opsi-setup-detector` also requires the installation of the product `opsipackagebuilder_wlm`, because the setup detector uses the PackageBuilder (if available).

You should therefore also install the product `opsipackagebuilder_wlm`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater install opsipackagebuilder_wlm
----

You can then deploy the two products to the desired clients, for example, using the `opsi-configed` management interface.

TIP: For Windows computers, we provide the setup detector as a stand-alone package, which can be installed independently of opsi: https://tools.43.opsi.org/stable/

===== Differences Across Windows, Linux, and macOS

While the `opsi-setup-detector` generally operates similarly across Windows, Linux, and macOS, there are distinct differences in how it analyzes installation files, using various auxiliary programs specific to each operating system:

* On Windows, detailed analyses of Inno Setups are conducted using the integrated tool `innounpack.exe`. Such in-depth analysis of Inno Setups is thus exclusive to the Windows environment.

* For working with the Windows Installer XML (commonly known as the WiX Toolset), the integrated tool `Dark.exe` is employed under Windows. Therefore, this level of detailed analysis is also specific to Windows.

* On Linux systems, `.deb` or `.rpm` packages are analyzed using the standard package management tools on Linux. Consequently, this type of detailed analysis is possible only on Linux systems.

==== Installing opsi PackageBuilder

The _opsi PackageBuilder (oPB)_ is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

The product `opsipackagebuilder_wlm` is one of the opsi standard products. If it is not yet installed on your server, use this command to install it:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-updater install opsipackagebuilder_wlm
----

You can proceed to deploy the localboot product to the clients, for instance, using the `opsi-configed` management interface.

.The opsi PackageBuilder (oPB) is a Localboot Product which you can deploy on the Clients.

Alternative approach to using the product:

You can install the opsi PackageBuilder (oPB) either as an opsi product on the opsi server and then deploy it to clients via `opsi-configed`. Alternatively, you can use one of the installation packages available at link:https://forum.opsi.org/viewtopic.php?p=32473#p32473[forum.opsi.org - opsi PackageBuilder].

NOTE: The opsi PackageBuilder (oPB) is a community-driven product, developed by Holger Pandel. Many thanks!
