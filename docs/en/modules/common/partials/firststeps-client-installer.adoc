== Using the Installer on the Client

This variant is particularly suitable for integrating individual computers as clients in an opsi environment. Here's how to proceed:

. Log in to the client.
. Download the installer from your opsi config server. You can find it at `\https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_the_config_server>:4447/public/opsi-client-agent/`; the Windows program is named `opsi-client-agent-installer.exe`.
. Run the installer; it unpacks itself into a temporary local directory and starts the contained `oca-installation-helper`. In the dialog window, enter the values for the client ID, the opsi service URL, the username, and the password. The fields are pre-filled as much as possible; adjust the values to your environment if necessary:
   * The client ID usually corresponds to the FQDN of the client.
   * The opsi service URL must be in the format `\https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_config_server>:4447`.
   * When installing the client for the first time, the username and password should be from an account that is a member of the `opsiadmin` group (see chapter xref:server:components/authorization.adoc[Authorizations]). When reinstalling, you can also use the client ID and the host key.
. The installer contacts the server via the opsi web service to register the client with the server. It then calls the included `opsi-script` to execute the `setup.opsiscript` of the client agent.

TIP: When executing the installer, you can specify parameters to automate processes, among other things. Further details are available in chapter xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc[Client Agent (Windows)].
