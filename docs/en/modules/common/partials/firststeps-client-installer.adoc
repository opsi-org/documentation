== Using the Installer

This method is ideal for integrating individual computers into an opsi environment as clients. Follow these steps:

. Log in to the client.
. Download the installer from your opsi config server. It is located at `\https://<fqdn_oder_ip_des_configservers>:4447/public/opsi-client-agent/`. The Windows program is called `opsi-client-agent-installer.exe`.
. Execute the installer. It will self-extract into a temporary local directory and launch `oca-installation-helper`. In the dialog window, enter the client ID, the opsi service URL, the username, and the password. Fields are pre-filled where possible; adjust these values to suit your environment:
* The client ID typically matches the FQDN of the client.
* The opsi service URL should follow the format `\https://<fqdn_oder_ip_des_configservers>:4447`.
* For first-time client installation, use the username and password of an account that is a member of the `opsiadmin` group (see the chapter xref:server:components/authorization.adoc[Authorizations]); for reinstalling, you can use the client ID and host key.
. The installer connects to the server via the opsi web service to register the client. It then runs the included `opsi-script` to execute the `setup.opsiscript` of the client agent.

TIP: When calling the installer, you can specify parameters which can automate various processes. For more information on this, refer to the chapter xref:clients:windows-client/windows-client-agent.adoc[Client Agent (Windows)].
