The offered tasks for MacOS:

. `Analyze single MacOS Installer file and generate an opsi package` +
Here it starts from a MacOS installer file and then goes through the whole process to create an opsi package. This process is described in the next chapter.

. `Create an opsi package template for MacOS` +
This point does not ask for a setup file, but creates a template comparable to the opsi product `opsi-template` with the exception that here the specifications from the product configuration are already taken over.
