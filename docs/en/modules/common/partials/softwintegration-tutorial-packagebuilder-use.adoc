== opsi PackageBuilder: Modifying a Script

Launch the opsi PackageBuilder (oPB) from the start menu. If you encounter difficulties (particularly when using a KDE desktop environment), you might need to start the program from a terminal instead. Simply input any path, and if an error message appears indicating that the path was not found, acknowledge it to proceed:

[source,console]
----
opsipackagebuilder --path /home
----

When you start opsi PackageBuilder for the first time, it will be in offline mode because it hasn't yet established a connection with the opsi server:

=== Initial Configuration

To set up the opsi PackageBuilder, click on the _Settings_ button. 

Configure the following on the _General_ tab:

* _Config server_: Input the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your opsi config server, such as `opsi.mycompany.org`.

* _opsiadmin User_: Enter the username of an administrator with access to the opsi service. This account should be a part of the `opsiadmin` group (refer to the section xref:server:components/authorization.adoc#server-components-authorization-users-and-groups[Users and Groups]).

* _opsiadmin Password_: Provide the corresponding password for the opsiadmin user. This password will be encrypted and is not visible. It's essential for the opsi PackageBuilder to communicate with the opsi server.

* _4.0.4 or newer_: Activate this checkbox.

* _SUDO without password_: This is the default setting; accept it as it is.

* _Package maintainer_: Enter your full name. This will be included in the changelogs.

* _Mail address_: Provide your email address here; it will also be featured in the changelogs.

.oPB Settings: *General* Tab

On the _Program_ tab, configure the following settings:

* Activate the checkbox _Extended changelog editor_.

* Select a _Development folder_; enter the full path to the directory in which the opsi packages are to be created. Ideally, this is the path to the mounted share with the opsi workbench. Optionally, you can select _Use existing network drive_.

* _Script eEditor_: Choose the text editor for script editing according to your operating system:

  - Windows: Accept the default setting (path to the oPB ScriptEditor).
  - Linux: Path to the editor, e.g. `/usr/bin/jedit`; leave the _Editor command line options_ field empty.
  - macOS: Path to the editor, e.g. `/Application/jedit`; _Editor command line options_ field remains empty.

On the _opsi Commands_ tab, adjust the following setting, which *deviates from the default configuration*:

* _Build command_: We recommend the following command: +
`opsi-makepackage -v`

* Activate the checkbox _Use depot functions_.

.oPB Settings: *opsi Commands* Tab

Save the settings and restart the opsi PackageBuilder. After restarting, the program should switch to online mode.

=== Modifying, packing and installing packages

To edit a package, select the _Open Package (F2)_ button and locate the directory created by the `opsi-setup-detector`, for instance, `w:\develop\newprod2`. This action will open the following dialog:

.Open an existing opsi Package.
image::opb_tab_product.png["Open an existing opsi Package.", pdfwidth=80%]

On the _Package_ tab, the metadata of the opsi product is displayed in the left column (refer to section <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration1>> for details). Script files are situated on the right. Next to each script file, you will find this button:

.oPB: *Edit* Button
image::opb_btnSkriptEdit.png["oPB: *Edit* Button ", pdfwidth=40%]

When you click on this button, the script editor specified in the settings will launch, allowing you to modify the script. On Windows, this typically defaults to the oPB-ScriptEditor. This editor comes equipped with features like colored syntax highlighting, optional source code folding (for a more compact view with comments), customizable lexer definition (accessible when launched from the start menu), auto-completion for syntax elements and variables, as well as customizable and reusable code blocks known as snippets.

The editor's core component is the link:https://www.scintilla.org/[Scintilla] module, which is also used by other renowned text editors like Notepad\++, CodeLite, etc. However, the lexical elements for opsi scripts, such as syntax highlighting and folding, are implemented using AutoIt. This is because Scintilla does not inherently provide specific highlighting for opsi scripts. Since AutoIt is an interpreter language, the ScriptEditor might not be as fast as other editors, particularly when editing very large scripts or with code folding activated.

The settings provide an option to enable or disable these functions when the editor is initiated via oPB. By default, syntax highlighting and folding are turned off when the editor is started from the start menu. However, you can activate them via the _View_ menu if needed.

TIP: Launch the editor from the command line to access specific options directly. The `--help` option displays information about available parameters.

On the _Dependencies_ tab, the dependencies established with other opsi products are displayed, as detailed in the section <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-priority_dependency>>.

The _Properties_ tab shows the product properties, including type, value, etc:

.oPB: *Properties* Tab
image::opb_tab_property.png["oPB: *Properties* Tab", pdfwidth=80%]

At the bottom of the window, you can see the following buttons:

[cols="4,16"]
|====
|Button | Description

|image:opb_btnPacken.png[] | Starts an SSH connection to the opsi server and executes the command for packaging (see section <<opsi-softwintegration-create-opsi-package-makeproductfile>>).
|image:opb_btnInstallieren.png[] | Starts an SSH connection to the opsi server and executes the install command (see section <<opsi-softwintegration-create-opsi-package-manager>>).
|image:opb_InstSetup.jpg[] | Similar to _Install_, but the package is also set to _setup_ on all clients on which it is marked as _installed_.
|====

CAUTION: Be very cautious when using the _Inst.+Setup_ button. Only use it when you're certain of its function and implications!
