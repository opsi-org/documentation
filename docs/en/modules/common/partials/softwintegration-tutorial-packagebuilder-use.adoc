==== The {opsi-package-builder} program to modify a script.

At the first start after the installation the {opsi-package-builder} starts in offline mode, because important configuration data for the connection with the {opsi-server} is missing.

.{opsi-package-builder}  First Start: Offline Mode

If the startup does not work this way and the start menu does not respond (observed under Linux / KDE), try it from the command line by specifying a path and confirm the error message that the path was not found:

[source,shell]
----
opsipackagebuilder --path /home

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-modify-with-opsi-packagebuilder_config]]
===== Initial configuration of the {opsi-package-builder}

To enter the missing configuration data open the _Settings_.

.{opsi-package-builder} Settings: General
image::opb_conf_general.jpeg["Settings: General",width=300]

In the _General_ tab please enter the following settings:

* _configserver_ : full name (FQDN) of your {opsi-configserver} (e.g. opsi.mycompany.org).

* _opsiadmin user_ : username of a member of the group _opsiadmin_ (preferably your username)

* _opsiadmin password_: the password of the user specified above. This will not be displayed and is stored encrypted. It's necessary for the {opsi-package-builder} to communicate with the opsi-server.

* _opsi Server Version_: opsi 4.1 or higher

* _opsi Workbench_ : `/var/lib/opsi/workbench`

* _command execution compatibility_ : opsi 4.0.4 or newer / Sudo without password

* _User_ : your full name (used in changelogs)

* _Email_ : your email address (used in changelogs)

.{opsi-package-builder} Settings: Program
image::opb_conf_program.jpeg["Settings: Program",width=300]

In the tab _Program_ please enter the following settings:

* _Use existing network drive_ : Check the box.

* _Development folder_ : Path to the directory where the opsi packages should be created. This is ideally the path to where the opsi_workbench of your opsi server is mounted.

* _script editor_ : +
The script editor of the {opsi-package-builder} is only available for Windows unfortunately.

** Under Windows leave it with the default settings.

** Under Linux: External editor: `/usr/local/bin/jedit` +
Command line options: (empty)

** On MacOS: External editor: `/Application/jedit` +
Command line options: (empty)

.{opsi-package-builder} Settings: Management
image::opb_conf_opsi.png["Settings: Management",width=300]

In the _Administration_ tab, we recommend the following setting, deviating from the default

* _Package_ : `opsi-makepackage -v`.


Save the settings and restart the {opsi-package-builder}.
The {opsi-package-builder} should now no longer report _Offline mode_.

===== Install, modify and pack packages with the {opsi-package-builder}.

.{opsi-package-builder} Start
image::opb_start.jpg[Start,width=150]

Use _Open package (F2)_ and select the directory in which you have created with the `opsi-setup-detector` a package. (e.g.: w:\newprod2 ) +
The product window opens with different tabs. The default tab is _Package_.

.{opsi-package-builder} Package Tab
image::opb_tab_product.jpg[Package Tab,width=200]

In this tab you see on the left side the general metadata of the opsi product as you have already been explained in <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration1>>.

On the right side you see the script files and next to it the button:

.{opsi-package-builder} Edit button
image::opb_btnSkriptEdit.png["Edit button",width=20]

With the button you can invoke the file in the script editor specified in the configuration and modify the script. On Windows this is the script editor of the {opsi-package-builder}.

.{opsi-package-builder} Script editor under Windows
image::opb_ScEdit.jpg["Script editor",width=300]

Key features:

* Color syntax highlighting.

* "Folding" of source code (optional: compact, with comments)

* Lexical definition customizable (to do this, the editor must be invoked via start menu entry)

* Autocomplete for syntax elements and variables

* Freely definable and reusable code blocks ("snippets")

The core component of the editor is the module Scintilla, which is also used in other well known editors, such as Notepad++. The lexical elements (syntax highlighting and folding) for the representation of the script language valid for opsi are however completely written in AutoIt, since Scintilla does not supply its own representation module for opsi scripts. Because AutoIt is an interpreter language, it's slower than other editors and is therefore only conditionally suitable for editing very large scripts, especially when source code convolution is switched on. In the settings, however, it's possible to specify whether the editor is invoke with these functions or not, provided that the call is made directly via the script tree. If the editor is open via the link in the start menu, syntax highlighting and convolution are generally switched off at startup and can be activated via the editor menu "View".

(The editor can also be open via the command line. More information about the possible command line parameters can be check with the "-help" option).

.{opsi-package-builder} Product variables tab (Properties)
