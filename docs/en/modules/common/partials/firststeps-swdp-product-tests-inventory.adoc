== Inventory (*hwaudit*/*swaudit*)

The `hwaudit` and `swaudit` products are used for hardware and software inventory on opsi clients. To install the two localboot products, follow these steps:

. In the management interface, switch to _Client configuration_ mode and select the client you want to configure.
. If not done previously, update the database either through the menu _File_ / _Reload all data_ or by clicking the icon on the far left (with the two arrows).
. Navigate to the _Localboot products_ tab.
. Click next to the _hwaudit_ product in the _Requested action_ column and select the _setup_ option from the drop-down menu. Do the same for the _swaudit_ product.
+
.Select *setup* for the two Products and confirm your Changes.

. The fourth icon from the left (the green tick) will turn red. Click on this icon to apply the settings to the opsi server.
. (Re)boot the client.

After booting the client, the first things you'll notice are the `opsi-script` window and the installer.

.After you've (re)booted the Client, *swaudit* is installed. (here: Windows)

The management interface will then display detailed information about the client under two separate tabs: _Hardware information_ and _Software information_.
