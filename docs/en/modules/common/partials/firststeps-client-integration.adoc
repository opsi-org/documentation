=== Integration of existing clients

To include existing clients in opsi, the {opsi-client-agent} (or opsi-linux-client-agent/opsi-mac-client-agent) must be installed on them.
This can be realised in several ways. After you have installed the {opsi-client-agent} as described below, the client will also appear in the client list of {opsi-configed}, unless you have already added the client there.

Basically there is the possibility to install the agent <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-installer,on the client>> or <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,to start the installation from the server>>.

Executing the installation directly on the client is suitable for individual computers.
For a mass rollout of the agent, have a look at <<opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy,opsi-deploy-client-agent>>.
If there is already another way to distribute software available, then it is also possible to distribute the opsi-client-agent by using the opsi-client-agent-installer or the opsi-client-agent MSI-package.

Once the agent is installed, available opsi products can be xref:rollout-products.adoc#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests[installed] on these clients.

==== Using the installer

. Logon to the client.
. Download the installer from your configserver. It is located at https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_the_configserver>:4447/public/opsi-client-agent/ and has the file name
opsi-client-agent-installer.exe (or opsi-linux-client-agent-installer.sh/opsi-mac-client-agent-installer.sh)
. Execute the installer (for linux and macos this must be done with root-rights, on windows a UAC-Request may be displayed)
. The installer will extract itself into a temporary local directory and start the oca-installation-helper, which shows a user interface with input fields for
Client-ID, Opsi Service URL, Username and Password. The fields are pre-filled, but you may need to add or change some of the data.
. Client-Id should be the fqdn of the Client. Opsi Service url should have the format https://<fqdn_or_ip_of_the_configserver>:4447. Username and Password should correspond
to a user of the group opsiadmin in case of a first installation. For reinstallation it is also possible to use Client-Id and pckey for authentication.
. The installer connects to the server to register the client at the server. Afterwards the installer calls the included opsi-script to execute the setup.opsiscript of the opsi-[linux-|mac-]client-agent.

When calling the installer, you can supply parameters which enable a fully automatic execution of the installation. Details can be found in the Manual.

==== Using opsi-deploy-client-agent

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` program installs the {opsi-client-agent} (or opsi-linux-client-agent/opsi-mac-client-agent) directly from the {opsi-server} on the clients.
This makes it easy to integrate a large number of clients from a server into an opsi environment.

Requirements for Windows clients:

* an open C$ share
* an open admin$ share
* an administrative account
* `winexe` must not be blocked by an antivirus program.
* The program `winexe` must be available on the server. It is part of the `opsi-windows-support` package.

Requirements for Linux clients:

* ssh-access with a user that can perform "sudo" or is root itself.

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` program can be found at `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent` (or opsi-linux-client-agent, opsi-mac-client-agent). +
Execute the script with 'root' privileges.

The program creates the client on the server, then copies the installation files and the configuration information, including the pckey, to the client. After copying the necessary information, `opsi-deploy-client-agent` starts the installation on the client by calling oca-installation-helper (non-interactive).

With the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` you can also install to a list of clients.
To do this, either any number of clients can be passed as the last parameter or the clients can be read from a file using the '-f' option.
When using a file, there must be a client on every line.

The program can work with IP addresses, hostnames or FQDNs. It will try to automatically detect what type of address it is processing.

Possible parameters can be found by using `--help`:
