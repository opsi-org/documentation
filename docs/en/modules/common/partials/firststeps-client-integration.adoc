= Integrating existing Clients

To add existing clients with an already installed operating system to opsi, install the client agent on the respective computer. The client will then appear in the client list of the management interface, even if you have not yet added it there.

There are two different methods to install the client agent:

* <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-installer>>: This method involves installation on the client and is suitable for individual computers.
* <<firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration-opsi-deploy>>: This method involves initiating installation on the server, suitable for mass rollout.

NOTE: After the client agent has been installed, you can deploy opsi products to the client (see chapter xref:clients:windows-client/rollout-products.adoc[Deploying Products (Client)]).

== *Using opsi-deploy-client-agent*

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` tool distributes the opsi client agent directly from the opsi server to the clients. This method offers a convenient way to integrate a large number of clients directly from the server into the opsi environment.

NOTE: If another software distribution option is already in place, it is advisable to perform the initial rollout via the `client-agent-installer` or the MSI package of the client agent.

Requirements for Windows clients:

* An open `c$` share.
* An open `admin$` share.
* An administrative account.
* The services `RpcSs` and `RpcEptMapper` must be running (from Windows 8, this is the default setting).
* A firewall that allows _File and Printer Sharing_ and _Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)_.
* The registry key `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` should have the value `1`.

You can find the `opsi-deploy-client-agent` on the opsi server in the directory `/var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-client-agent`. The program requires `root` rights; alternatively, it is sufficient if the user is a member of the `opsifileadmins` group. The tool performs the following steps:

. It creates clients on the server.
. It copies the installation and configuration files (e.g., the host key).
. It starts the installation via `oca-installation-helper` (non-interactive).

The `opsi-deploy-client-agent` tool accepts IP addresses, hostnames, and FQDNs. It attempts to automatically recognize the type of address provided by the user.

To begin, change to the main directory of the program:

[source,console]
----
cd /var/lib/opsi/depot/opsi-linux-client-agent
----

Invoke the program with the `--help` parameter to display the online help:

TIP: You can also use `opsi-deploy-client-agent` to process a list of clients. To do this, either pass the clients as the last parameter or use `-f` followed by the filename containing the list. In such a file, list each client on a separate line.
