[[opsi-quickinstall-section]]
== Opsi-QuickInstall
Opsi-QuickInstall is a program to quickly and easily install an {opsi-server} on a Linux system.
You can find our supported Linux distributions here:
xref:opsi-quickinstall-supported_distros[Supported Linux Distributions]


[[opsi-quickinstall-prep]]
=== Preparation
Check the entry for the {opsi-server} in the file '/etc/hosts' or check the output of:

[source,prompt]
----
getent hosts $(hostname -f)
----

The result should look like the following example: +
'192.168.1.1 server.domain.tld server'

Here the IP address must belong to the network interface, to which the Clients will be connecting.

If the result looks different from the above example (contains e.g. '127.0.0.1' or 'localhost'),
or the fully qualified hostname does not contain one or more dots, then you must correct your name resolution (DNS or `/etc/hosts` file).

You can find further information on that in the chapters 3.3.1 to 3.3.3 in the opsi Getting Started:
https://download.uib.de/opsi_stable/doc/html/en/opsi-getting-started-v4.2/opsi-getting-started-v4.2.html#opsi-getting-started-introduction-software-and-configuration-preconditions


[[opsi-quickinstall-download]]
=== Download and first Start
You can download Opsi-QuickInstall as zip-file under the following link:
https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/stable/quickinstall/ .

Unzip the file and open the folder 'opsi-quickinstall'.
Now you must decide whether you want to execute the installation with or without graphical user interface.

Both versions are described below.

You can find more information on the properties QuickInstall asks for in the
opsi-manual under chapter '9.5.10.1 The product l-opsi-server': https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/stable/documentation/opsi-manual-v4.2-en.pdf .
There you also find the default values of the properties.
Different from the manual is only the default-value of the property **allow_reboot**; this one is  __false__ in QuickInstall.

[[opsi-quickinstall-gui]]
=== Opsi-Quickinstall GUI-Version

Open the folder 'gui' and execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' (for example per double click).

A window appears in which you can first select the language for QuickInstall and the type of installation:

.Language and type of installation
image::oqi.png["Screenshot: Language and type of installation", pdfwidth=90%]

In the custom installation you can make more detailed settings.

Click on 'next>' and answer the questions. For some questions you will find information signs on the right-hand side.
These can give you more information about the question on mouse click.

[[Information]]
.Information
image::oqiInfo.png["Screenshot: Information", pdfwidth=90%]

The questions on name and password of the opsi admin user give example values (also shown on the image <<Information>>).
For security reasons you should change these values. Do NOT use the examples!

After the queries, QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers.
If everything is correct, click 'finish', type in your password and click 'finish' again. Then the installation of the {opsi-server} will start.

.Installation
image::quickinstall_l-opsi-server.png["Screenshot: Installation", pdfwidth=90%]

The installation may take some minutes. In the end, QuickInstall shows you whether the installation was successful.

.Result
image::oqiFailed.png["Screenshot: Result", pdfwidth=90%]

If the result is 'success', your {opsi-server} is ready for use and configured. You may now start importing opsi products
(see https://download.uib.de/opsi_stable/doc/html/en/opsi-getting-started-v4.2/opsi-getting-started-v4.2.html#opsi-getting-started-installation-config-get-essential-products). +
If the result is 'failed', you can search in the log files for the error.
If you have a support contract, you can directly contact uib.


[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui]]
=== Opsi-Quickinstall No-GUI-Version

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_start]]
==== Start

Open the folder 'nogui'. Execute the file 'opsi_quick_install_project' on the console as root.
For this purpose, use one of the following parameters:

* `-d` to use the default values for the installation of the {opsi-server} and immediately start the installation.
(IMPORTANT: Through that, QuickInstall will also create the opsi admin user with example values for the name and password.
QuickInstall uses 'Alexandra'(Opsi-QuickInstall version 4.2.0.1) or 'adminuser'(from Opsi-QuickInstall version 4.2.0.1-2 on) as name and
'linux123' as password. For security reasons you should change these values afterwards!).
* `-f <file>` to use the values from a file for the installation of the {opsi-server} and immediately start the installation.
* `-n` (recommended) to start a setup program on the console, in which you can set the values for the installation seperately.

So for example execute
----
sudo ./opsi_quick_install_project -n
----

The operation of the setup program is shortly described in the following.

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_setup]]
==== Setup Program
If you chose the parameter `-n`, answer the questions that are asked.
On each question you also have the possibility to type in one of the following commands:

* `-b` to jump back to the previous question,
* `-h` (only for questions that are marked with a `*` at the end) to get further information on this question,
* type nothing in and press Enter to use the default value for this question.

Afterwards QuickInstall will show you an overview where you can check all your answers.
If everything is correct, click Enter to start the installation of the {opsi-server}.

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_installation]]
==== Installation of the {opsi-server}
The installation of the {opsi-server} may take some minutes. In the end, QuickInstall shows you whether the installation was successful.

.Result
image::quickinstallNoGuiFailed.png["Screenshot: Result", pdfwidth=90%]

If the result is 'success', your {opsi-server} is ready for use and configured. You may now start importing opsi products
(see https://download.uib.de/opsi_stable/doc/html/en/opsi-getting-started-v4.2/opsi-getting-started-v4.2.html#opsi-getting-started-installation-config-get-essential-products). +
If the result is 'failed', you can search in the log files for the error.
If you have a support contract, you can directly contact uib.


[[opsi-quickinstall-supported_distros]]
=== Supported Linux Distributions
We give the distribution names here according to the output of the command `lsb_release` or according to the file `os-release`.
This is important because these are the names Opsi-QuickInstall works with.
