[[opsi-quickinstall-section]]
= opsi QuickInstall

opsi QuickInstall is a program to quickly and easily install an {opsi-server} on a Linux system--via a graphical setup tool or on the command line. +
You can find our supported Linux distributions here:
xref:opsi-quickinstall-supported_distros[Supported Linux Distributions]

[[opsi-quickinstall-prep]]
== Preparations

First, make sure that the {opsi-server} has a valid DNS hostname. To do this, either check the entries in the `/etc/hosts` file or enter the following command:

[source,prompt]
----
getent hosts $(hostname -f)
----

The result should look like this for example:

[source]
----
192.168.1.1 server.domain.tld server
----

The output on your system should show the server's IP address to which the opsi clients connect later on. It's followed by the associated hostname, and the third field contains an optional alias (here: `server`), under which the computer can also be reached.

The file may look different on your distribution. If it contains only entries for `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`, edit the file `/etc/hosts` in the text editor of your choice. For the {opsi-server}, enter at least the IP address and the full host name, optionally an alias.

NOTE: For more information, please read https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/getting-started/server/requirements.html#opsi-getting-started-introduction-software-and-configuration-preconditions.

[[opsi-quickinstall-download]]
== Download opsi QuickInstall

opsi-QuickInstall can be found on our servers under the following link: https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/stable/quickinstall/

Download the zip file to your computer and unpack it, for example using this command on the shell:

[source,prompt]
----
unzip opsi-quick-install.zip
----

Alternatively unpack the archive via the file manager of your graphical desktop environment (right click / _Unpack here_). You can install opsi QuickInstall wither with a graphical user interface or via the command line. The next two sections explain both ways.

NOTE: The installer asks for so-called properties. For more information, please read the chapter on https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/manual/modules/linux.html#opsi-manual-linux-localboot-l-opsi-server[The product l-opsi-server]. Here you can also find the default values of the properties. Note that for opsi QuickInstall the default for `allow_reboot` is set to `false`.

[[opsi-quickinstall-gui]]

The installation may take a few minutes. When it's finished, opsi QuickInstall will tell you if it was successful. If you see the message `success`, then your {opsi-server} is configured and ready for operation. You can now start with the installation of https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/getting-started/server/minimal-products.html[opsi products].

If you see a dialog like in <<oqiFailed>> instead, please check the log files for error messages. You can find the logs in the two files `/var/log/opsi-quick-install-l-opsi-server.log` and `/tmp/opsi_quickinstall.log`.

[[oqiFailed]]

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui]]
== opsi QuickInstall: Installation on the Command Line

The directory `nogui` contains the program `opsi_quick_install_project`, which supports the following parameters:

* `-d`: The setup program uses the default values for the {opsi-server} installation. It sets up the opsi admin user with the username `Alexandra` (opsi QuickInstall version 4.2.0.1) or `adminuser` (from version 4.2.0.1-2) and the password `linux123`.
+
IMPORTANT: For security reasons change these default values after the installation.
* `-f <file>`: The setup program uses the values from the specified file for the {opsi-server} installation.
* `-n`: The setup program starts in interactive mode and asks for some parameters during the installation (_recommended_).

[[opsi-quickinstall-nogui_setup]]
=== Starting the Setup Program in Interactive Mode

To start the setup program in interactive mode, enter this command:

[source,prompt]
----
sudo ./opsi_quick_install_project -n
----

After that, answer the questions. You can enter the following commands at any time:

* `-b`: jumps back to the previous question
* `-h`: displays additional information for questions that are marked with `*` 
* [Enter]: uses the default values for a question

A summary at the end shows all your answers for a final check. If everything is correct, click [Enter] to start the installation of the {opsi-server}.

The installation may take a few minutes. When it's finished, opsi QuickInstall will tell you if it was successful. If you see the message `success`, then your {opsi-server} is configured and ready for operation. You can now start with the installation of https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/getting-started/server/minimal-products.html[opsi products].

If you see the message `failed` instead, instead, please check the log files `/var/log/opsi-quick-install-l-opsi-server.log` and `/tmp/opsi_quickinstall.log` for error messages. 

.The setup program provides information about errors and log files.
