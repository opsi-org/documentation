[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-script-structure]]
=== Structure of an *opsi-script* Script

The following sections will detail the key components of an `opsi-script` script tailored for Windows computers. As an illustration, here is an example of a basic `opsi-script` script:

// Dieses Beispiel ist Bestandteil einer pädagogischen Abfolge
// Daher bitte nicht modifizieren
// ohne die Details mit den Trainern das abzusprechen
// auch wenn etwas veraltet ist
[source,ini]
----
[Actions]
WinBatch_tightvnc_silent_install

[WinBatch_tightvnc_silent_install]
"%ScriptPath%\tightvnc-1.3.9-setup.exe" /silent
----

An `opsi-script` script is structured into two main types of sections:  <<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-primary-sections,primary>> and <<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-secondary-sections,secondary>> sections. Similar to INI files, each section is introduced by its name enclosed in square brackets.

The core activities of software installation are carried out in the secondary sections, which are invoked by the primary sections. Each secondary section is designated for specific topics and follows a unique syntax: the section name starts with the type, followed by a user-defined name.

In the provided example, the primary section `[Actions]` triggers the secondary section `[WinBatch_tightvnc_silent_install]`; this section belongs to the `WinBatch` type. The contents of a `WinBatch` section are executed using the Windows API. Here, the `msiexec` tool is employed to install (`/i`) the 64 bit version of TightVNC silently (using the `/quiet` option). The `/norestart` option is included to prevent the computer from rebooting after the installation, which is a specific requirement for TightVNC.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-primary-sections]]
==== Primary Sections

* *Actions*: The `[Actions]` section is essentially the main program, marking the commencement of script processing.

* *Sub-Sections*: Sections of the program required to be executed multiple times can be organized into sub-sections. These sub-sections can also be externalized into separate files for ease of use and reference.

The primary sections, which function as the main programs, dictate the script's flow. In these sections, you can use variables, conditional statements, functions, and other programming constructs. For more detailed information on these elements, please refer to the section <<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands>>.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-secondary-sections]]
==== Secondary Sections

* *Files*: For file operations, such as
  - Copying (with version control, recursive, etc.)
  - Deleting
  - Creating directories
  - etc.

* *WinBatch*: For executing through the Windows API. Typically, setup programs are run in a non-interactive mode within these sections.

* *ShellScript*: This section's content is executed by the operating system's standard shell. For Windows, this shell is `cmd.exe`, whereas for Linux and macOS, it's typically `bash`. So, this is the place to put regular batch scripts.

* *ExecWith*: The content of this section is passed on to an external program (like an interpreter) for execution. For instance, `ExecWith` is used to integrate link:https://www.autoitscript.com/site/[AutoIt] scripts into the `opsi-script` script.

* *Registry*: These sections contain specific instructions for modifying the Windows registry. 

* *LinkFolder*: These sections are used to create or delete shortcuts, such as those on the desktop or in the start menu.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-global-constants]]
==== Global constants

`opsi-script` also supports the use of global constants. These constants act as placeholders and you can use them in primary and secondary sections. By employing global constants, you can ensure that paths are correctly set across various environments, such as systems with different languages or operating system versions.

Below are some examples of global constants:

* *%ProgramFiles64Dir%*: `c:\program files` at 64 Bit
* *%ProgramFiles32Dir%*: `c:\program files (x86)` at 64 Bit
* *%SystemRoot%*: `c:\windows`
* *%System%*: `c:\windows\system32`
* *%opsiTmpDir%*: `c:\opsi.org\tmp`
* *%ScriptPath%*: <path to running script>

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-second-example]]
==== Example: installing TightVNC

In order to illustrate this concept, let's consider another example script. For installing the program, a silent execution of `setup.exe` in the secondary section `WinBatch_tightvnc_silent_install` would typically suffice. However, if the installation is repeated, an interactive dialog will appear (because of a running service). In such cases, AutoIt can be used to automatically close the dialog box:

// Dieses Beispiel ist Bestandteil einer pädagogischen Abfolge
// Daher bitte nicht modifizieren
// ohne die Details mit den Trainern das abzusprechen
// auch wenn etwas veraltet ist
[source,ini]
----
[Actions]
Message "Installing tightvnc 1.3.9 ..."
ExecWith_autoit_confirm "%ScriptPath%\autoit3.exe" WINST /letThemGo
WinBatch_tightvnc_silent_install
KillTask "autoit3.exe"

[WinBatch_tightvnc_silent_install]
"%ScriptPath%\tightvnc-1.3.9-setup.exe" /silent

[ExecWith_autoit_confirm]
; Wait for the confirm dialog which only appears if tightvnc was installed before as service
; Waiting for the window to appear
WinWait("Confirm")
; Activate (move focus to) window
WinActivate("Confirm")
; Choose answer no
Send("N")
----

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands]]
==== Important Commands for Primary Sections

The next sections provide a concise overview of the fundamental commands used in primary sections of `opsi-script` scripts. This includes the use of variables, statements, conditional statements, functions, and more. For a comprehensive reference and detailed explanations, please refer to the xref:opsi-script-manual:opsi-script-manual.adoc[*opsi-script*] chapter.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands-string-variable]]
===== String Variables

Variable Declaration:: `DefVar <variable name> [= <initial value>]`

Variable Assignment:: `Set <variable name> = <value>`

In the following example, a variable `$ProductId$` is declared and assigned the value `"firefox"`:

[source,ini]
----
DefVar $ProductId$
Set $ProductId$ = "firefox"
----

Alternatively, it's shorter to write:

[source,ini]
----
DefVar $ProductId$ = "firefox"
----

IMPORTANT: The handling of string variables differs between primary and secondary sections. In primary sections, string variables are treated as independent objects. However, in secondary sections, they are replaced by the content of the variable before the section is executed. This distinction is crucial, especially when copying and pasting string expressions within the script.

Consequently, string variables can only be declared and assigned values in primary sections. When combining variables and strings into a string expression, the operator `"+"` is required:

[source,ini]
----
"Installing "+ $ProductId$ +" ..."
----

In secondary sections, string variables are replaced by the content of the variable before the section is executed:

[source,ini]
----
"Installing $ProductId$ ..."
----

This has the advantage that you can easily work with `opsi-script` variables in sections that are executed outside the script (`ExecWith`, `ShellScript`).

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands-message]]
===== Statements: *Message* and *ShowBitmap*

To display text during installation, use the command `Message <string>`. Here, substitute `<string>` with the specific text message you wish to show:

[source,ini]
----
Message "Installing "+ $ProductId$ +" ..."
----

Instead of text messages, you can also display graphics using the `ShowBitmap` statement. The images should be in BMP, JPG, or PNG formats, ideally sized at 160{nbsp}x{nbsp}160 pixels. Additionally, you can include a caption with the `subtitle` parameter:

[source,ini]
----
ShowBitmap "%ScriptPath%\python.png" "Python"
----

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands-if-else-endif]]
===== Conditional Statements: *if*, *elseif*/*else*, and *endif*

You can conditionally execute code based on specific criteria:

* `if`: This initiates the conditional statement. If the specified condition is true, the script executes the instructions within the subsequent block. If the condition is false, the block is bypassed.

* `;statement(s)`: These are the instructions executed when the condition in the `if` statement is true. This block can contain one or multiple statements that run only if the specified condition is met.

* `elseif <condition>`: This is an optional part. If the condition in the `if` statement isn't met, this condition is then evaluated. If it's true, the script executes the instructions in the subsequent block. It allows for additional, sequential conditions to be checked if earlier conditions aren't fulfilled.

* `else`: This optional section executes if all the preceding conditions are false. It acts as a fallback, containing instructions that run when none of the previous conditions are met.

* `endif`: This marks the end of the conditional structure, indicating the conclusion of the conditional checks.

[source,ini]
----
if <condition>
	;statement(s)
[elseif <condition>
;statement(s)]
[
else
	;statement(s)
]
endif
----

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands-functions]]
===== Functions

* *HasMinimumSpace*: Checks for free space on the hard disk.
* *FileExists*: Checks if a file or directory exists.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands-error]]
===== Comments, Errors and Logging

* *Comment Marker*: Lines starting with a semicolon (`;`) are not interpreted.

* *Comment*: Writes a comment to the logfile.

* *LogError*: Writes an error message to the logfile.

* *IsFatalError*: Cancels the execution of the running script and reports the installation as failed.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-elementary-commands-requirements]]
===== Condition for Execution

* *requiredOpsiscriptVersion*: This specifies the minimum version of `opsi-script` that is required for the script to function properly:

[source,ini]
----
requiredOpsiscriptVersion >= "4.12.3.6"
----

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-winst-commands]]
===== Other important *opsi-script* Functions

* *String Lists*: String lists are quite powerful and particularly useful for processing output from external programs (refer to the section xref:opsi-script-manual:prim-section.adoc#opsi-script-stringlist[Processing String Lists] for more details).

* *Function `ExitWindows`*: This function is used to restart or shut down the system and exit `opsi-script`.
  - `ExitWindows /Reboot`: Triggers a system reboot upon completion of the script.
  - `ExitWindows /ImmediateReboot`: Executes an immediate system reboot.
  - `ExitWindows /ImmediateLogout`: Immediately terminates script processing and exits `opsi-script`.

* *Product Properties*: Certain products may require the configuration of options, which are evaluated on a client-specific basis at runtime (see section <<opsi-client-softwintegration-create-opsi-package>> for more information).

Access to the property values is provided through the `GetProductProperty` function:

[source,ini]
----
if GetProductProperty("example-property", "no") = "yes"
    Files_copy_extra_files
endif
----

* *Encoding*: Use UTF-8 encoding in your scripts and place the instruction at the beginning of the file:

[source,ini]
----
encoding=utf8
----
