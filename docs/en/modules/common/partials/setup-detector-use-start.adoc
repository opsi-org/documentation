[[opsi-setup-detector-use-start]]
=== Start and Condfigurartion

On Windows, you can launch the `opsi-setup-detector` from the Start menu, where it is located at _opsi.org_ / _opsi-setup-detector_. For macOS users, the `opsi-setup-detector` can be accessed via _Programs_, while on Linux, it is typically found in the start menus at _System Tools_. Additionally, on most Linux desktop environments, you have the option to directly enter the full path to the executable file (`/opt/opsi-setup-detector/opsisetupdetector`) in a quick launcher ([Alt]{plus}[F2]) or terminal window.

TIP: In Windows, the `opsi-setup-detector` can be conveniently started directly from the Explorer. By right-clicking on an installation file for an application, you will find an option in the context menu that allows you to initiate the tool for analysis.

.You can start the *opsi-setup-detector* via the Explorer's Context Menu.

Upon the initial launch of the program, a configuration dialog will appear. It's essential to provide information for the following three entries:

* `fullName`: Enter your full name as you wish it to appear in the `changelog.txt` file.

* `email_address`: Provide your email address, which will also be included in the `changelog.txt` file.

* `workbench_Path`: Specify the path to the directory where you will create the opsi packages. +
Ideally, this should be the path to the share where your opsi server's workbench is mounted (see the chapter xref:server:components/samba.adoc[Samba]).

.After the first start, configure the *opsi-setup-detector*.

Additionally, you can configure further (optional) settings. For the opsi web service `opsiconfd` (`\https://<opsi-server>:4447`, see the chapter xref:server:components/opsiconfd.adoc[The *opsiconfd* Service]), you should complete the following fields:

* `Service_URL`: Enter the URL of the opsi web service, formatted as `\https://<opsi-server>:4447`.

* `Service_user`: Specify the username required for connecting to the opsi web service.

* `Service_pass`: Input the password associated with the `Service_user` for the web service connection. Skip this, and the the `opsi-setup-detector` will prompt for it when necessary.

WARNING: Possible security risk: Even if the password is stored in encrypted form, it can still be decrypted after analyzing the (open) source code.

Other optional settings include:

* `control_in_toml_format`: Check this box if you want to create a `control` file in TOML format (refer to the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-softwintegration-example-control[Example: *control* File] for more details). +
*Attention*: This option requires at least opsi 4.3!

* `dependencies_for_all_actionrequests`: This setting determines whether dependencies should be allowed for action requests other than `setup`. +
*Attention*: This feature requires at least opsi 4.3 and should be used with extreme caution!

TIP: For a comprehensive explanation of all the available settings, refer to the chapter [xref:opsi-modules:setup-detector.adoc[*opsi-setup-detector* (free)].

Once the configuration is saved, you will see the start page.
