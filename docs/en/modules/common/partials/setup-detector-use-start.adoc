=== Opsi-setup-detector Start and necessary configurations

The `opsi-setup-detector` can be started from the programs menu and can be found there under _opsi.org_ / _opsi-setup-detector_. +
At macOS you will find the `opsi-setup-detector` at _Applications_ and at Linux in the start menu at _System_. 

TIP: Under Windows the `opsi-setup-detector` is also integrated into the context menu of the explorer in order to call the setup program directly for analysis with the right mouse button.

After the first start of the opsi-setup-detector a configuration mask appears.
The following information is required here:

* `fullname:`   (Used for entries in the changelog.txt)

* `email_address:`  (Used for entries in the changelog.txt)

* `workbench_path:` : Path to the directory in which the opsi packages are going to be created. +
