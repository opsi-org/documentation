[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script]]
== Testing and improving a Script

There are two distinct methods for testing and enhancing a product:

* Test the script you've developed without installing it on the opsi server or deploying it to a client (<<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-standalone>>). 

* Evaluate the entire product by installing it on the server and deploying it to a client (<<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-integrated>>). 

NOTE: The instructions that follow are based on the assumption that the product you are testing was created using the `opsi-setup-detector`.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-standalone]]
=== Standalone Tests

Start the application `opsi-script-gui`:

* Windows: Double-click to open `opsi-script.exe`. If the client agent is installed on your computer, locate the program at _C:\Program Files (x86)\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsi-script\opsi-script.exe_. Otherwise, manually copy the contents of the `opsi-script\windows\x86\` directory from the `\\<opsiserver>\opsi_depot` share to your Windows computer.

NOTE: On Windows 10, you should right-click the `opsi-script.exe` file in Explorer and choose _Run as administrator_ from the context menu.

* Linux: Start `/opt/opsi-script/opsi-script-gui`.

* macOS: Launch the application via the _/Applications/opsi-script_ menu.

Upon starting the application, you will be presented with the following window:

.Open *opsi-script-gui* in interactive Mode.
image::opsi-script-interactive.png["Open *opsi-script-gui* in interactive Mode.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

Use _Select Script_ to choose the script you're looking to test. Next, click _Start_ to execute the script on your computer. Alternatively, for a syntax check, select _Test_Syntax_. This action checks the script for syntax errors but does not run it on your computer (see the section xref:opsi-script-manual:cli-params.adoc#opsi-script-testsyntax[Checking the Script Syntax]).

To observe how `opsi-script` interprets the script, you can use the `opsi-logviewer`. 

TIP: Adjust the log level using the slider in the bottom right corner of the `opsi-logviewer` to display more or fewer details.

If you need to modify the script, you have a couple of options for editing:

* Open the project in the opsi PackageBuilder and use the editor provided there.
* Alternatively, use a text editor like jEdit that supports `opsi-script` syntax highlighting. This feature is typically included in the basic setup of the opsi products.

.The text editor jEdit supports syntax highlighting for *opsi-script* scripts.
image::jedit-with-winst-script.png["The text editor jEdit supports syntax highlighting for *opsi-script* scripts.", pdfwidth=80%]

Now, you can save the changes and keep the editor open. Simply switch back to the opsi-script window and click on the _Start_ button again; there's no need to reselect the script. To observe the modifications, refer to the `opsi-logviewer`. You can refresh the log by choosing _Reload_ from the right-click context menu or by clicking the reload button on the toolbar.

To fine-tune your scripts to perfection, you can repeat these steps as needed:

1. Edit and save the script in your text editor.
2. Run the script (again) in `opsi-script`.
3. Check the updated logs to confirm the impact of your changes.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-integrated]]
=== Integrated tests

For the integrated tests, roll out the product on a test client:

* Open the script `setup.opsiscript` in an editor and make changes if necessary; save the changes:
  - Open the project in opsi PackageBuilder and start the editor provided here.
  - Use a text editor such as jEdit with `opsi-script` syntax highlighting (included in the basic setup of the opsi products).

* Build the product:
  - Variant 1: Open the project in opsi PackageBuilder and click on the _Build_ button.
  - Option 2: Open a terminal on the opsi server or log in via SSH, e.g. with PuTTY. Switch to the workbench (`/var/lib/opsi/workbench`) and then to the project directory. Call the following command: +
`opsi-makepackage`

* Install the product on the opsi server:
  - Variant 1: Click on the _Install_ button in the opsi PackageBuilder.
  - Variant 2: Run the following command in the project directory in the terminal: +
`opsi-package-manager -i <myproctid_version.opsi>` +
Replace `<myproctid_version.opsi>` with the name of the opsi package (as it was output during the build process).

* Deploy the product via the `opsi-configed` management interface:

. Select the test client on the _Clients_ tab.
. Select the product on the _Localboot products_ tab. If your opsi package does not appear there (which is normal after the first installation), press the button on the very left of the toolbar or select _File_ / _Reload all data_ from the menu.
. Set the product to _setup_ and save the changes.
. Start the client or call up _on_demand_ from the context menu for running clients.
. Wait until the product has been installed on the client.
. Switch to the _Logfiles_ tab and then to _instlog_ and view the log file.

TIP: Adjust the log level using the slider in the bottom right corner to display more or fewer details.

To further customize your scripts, you can repeat these steps:

1. Edit the script in the editor and save your changes.
2. Build the product.
3. Install the product on the server.
4. Deploy the product on the client.
5. Check the log file.

== *opsi-makepackage*: Packaging the Product 

To package the product, navigate to the product's main directory and execute the command `opsi-makepackage`.

TIP: It’s a good practice to generate an accompanying MD5 checksum file. Tools like `opsi-package-updater` use this file to verify the package’s integrity post-transfer.

By default, `opsi-makepackage` automatically creates an MD5 checksum file. Should you wish to disable this feature, use the following parameter when executing the command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-makepackage --no-md5
----

When transferring packages to opsi depot servers, `opsi-makepackage` uses the `zsync` tool, which only transmits the differing parts of packages, thereby conserving bandwidth. This process needs a `.zsync` file, which `opsi-makepackage` automatically generates. To turn off this functionality, disable the feature using the following parameter:

[source,console]
----
opsi-makepackage --no-zsync
----

If you encounter storage issues in the `/tmp` temporary directory while creating large packages, you can define an alternative temporary directory using `--temp-directory`.

Additionally, before building a package, `opsi-makepackage` examines if a package with an identical name or version number already resides in the directory. Should this occur, the tool will prompt you for your preferred course of action:

[source,console]
----
Package file '/var/lib/opsi/workbench/mytest/mytest_3.14-1.opsi' already exists.
Press <O> to overwrite, <C> to abort or <N> to specify a new version:
----

Press [O] to overwrite the existing package, press [C] to halt the process, or opt for [N] to provide a fresh version number for the product or package.

TIP: More details about the `opsi-makepackage` tool and its various options are available in the section xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-makepackage[*opsi-makepackage*].

[[opsi-softwintegration-create-opsi-package-manager]]
== *opsi-package-manager*: Installing the Product

To install opsi products, use the `opsi-package-manager` command. First, navigate to the main directory of the product and execute the following command:

[source,console]
----
opsi-package-manager -i <myproductid_version.opsi>
----

TIP: For additional details about the `opsi-package-manager` tool and its parameters, refer to section xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-package-manager[*opsi-package-manager*].

[[opsi-softwintegration-example-control]]
== Example: *control* File

Since opsi 4.3, you can create a `control` file in TOML format. If such a `control.toml` file exists, it is considered the definitive source and should be properly maintained.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tool-opsi-newprod]]
== *opsi-newprod*: Creating a Product

Apart from the graphical tools for creating opsi products introduced in this chapter, the `opsi-newprod` command line tool is available to create a basic structure for opsi products. Upon launching, it initially inquires whether you want to create a localboot or a netboot product.

NOTE: For products installed via the client agent or `opsi-script`, opting for `localboot` is appropriate. Choose `netboot` for products that are executed via the opsi Linux boot image, like operating system installations.

.First, select the Type of opsi Product you wish to create.
image::newprod-localboot.png["First, select the Type of opsi Product you wish to create.", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

Use the [Tab] key to navigate to the _OK_ option, or press [F12] to confirm your selection. In the next dialog, enter the information for your new opsi product:

.Enter the Information about the Product.
image::newprod-product-info.png["Enter the Information about the Product.", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

Fill in the fields with the appropriate information:

* _Product id_: This is a unique identifier for the product and is generally independent of the version. Only use lower case letters, no spaces or special characters; the hyphen `-` is permitted as a separator.

* _Product name_: This is the name of the product; we recommend avoiding special characters.

* _Description_: Enter additional information about the product. Tools like `opsi-configed` will display this under _Description_.

* _Advice_: If you want to include further information, for example, on how to use the product, this is the place. `opsi-configed` displays these under _Note_.

* _Product version_: The version of the packaged software is shown here; a maximum of 32 characters are allowed.

* _Package version_: This is the version of the package for the specified product version. It's used to differentiate between packages that have the same product version but, for example, have updated or corrected `opsi-script` scripts.

* _License required_: This setting does not impact localboot products. For netboot products, however, it specifies whether a license key should be obtained from the license management system.

* _Priority_: The value affects the order in which installations are executed, with possible values ranging from `100` (indicating installation at the very beginning) to `-100` (indicating installation at the very end). Additionally, dependencies on other products may also influence the sequence of installation.

Next, specify the scripts that you provide for the various actions:

.Enter the Name of the Scripts.
image::newprod-script-names.png["Enter the Name of the Scripts.", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

Enter the following information:

* _Setup script_: Usually, this is `setup.ins`.

* _Uninstall script_: Usually, this is `uninstall.ins`.

* _Update script_: The script is designed to apply small modifications to an existing, large installation. When the product's action request is set to `setup`, this update script is automatically run following the completion of the setup script's execution.

* _Always script_: This script runs each time the client agent is activated, for instance, following every system startup.

* _Once script_: The script has the resulting state `not_installed`. It's a rarely used option that should be ignored unless you have a specific purpose for it.

* _Custom script_: Such a script neither alters subsequent actions nor affects the resulting state. It’s a seldom-used option, best left alone unless you're certain of its application.

* _User login script_: This is used to make modifications to the profile of the currently logged-in user after they've logged in. This only works if you're using the xref:opsi-modules:user-profile.adoc[User Profile Management] extension.

[cols="8,8,8"]
|====
|Typ | Resulting State | Subsequent Action

| `setup` | `installed` | `none`
| `uninstall` | `not_installed` | `none`
| `update` | `installed` | `none`
| `always` | `installed` | `always`
| `once` | `not_installed` | `none`
| `custom` | _unchanged_ | _unchanged_
| `User login` | _unchanged_ | _unchanged_
|====

Now that the product details are specified, you can define dependencies with other products if needed. Otherwise, select _No_ to proceed.

.Would you like to define a Dependency?
image::newprod-product-new-dependency.png["Would you like to define a Dependency?", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

If you've chosen _Yes_, the following dialog appears:

.Define the Product Dependency accurately.
image::newprod-product-dependency.png["Define the Product Dependency accurately.", width=800, pdfwidth=80%]

Enter the following information:

* _Dependency for action_: This contains the action of the product (that you are currently creating) for which the dependency applies (currently only setup`).

* _Required product id_: Enter the ID of the produc for which there is a dependency.

* _Required action_: You can either request the `setup` action or the `installed` status (see below).

* _Required installation status_: This setting indicates the expected status of the dependent product, typically `installed`. If the actual status differs, the system will automatically set the product to `setup`.

* _Requirement type_: This option defines the installation sequence for the product dependencies. If the dependent product must be installed before the installation of the current product can commence, select `before`. Conversely, if it should be installed after the current product, choose `after`. If the installation order is irrelevant, you can leave this field empty.

NOTE: Currently, there is no universal mechanism for handling uninstallation dependencies in opsi products. The mechanism outlined here is dependable only for `action: setup` and the respective setup actions to be executed (`before`/`after`), as well as for confirming the `installed` status. Specifying a `requiredAction: uninstall` will invariably result in an error message.

TIP: The actual installation order is determined by a mix of product dependencies and their set priorities. For more details on how these factors interact, refer to the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-priority_dependecy[Priority and Dependencies].

.A(nother) product property to create?
image::newprod-new-property.png["Screenshot:  A(nother) product property to create?", pdfwidth=40%]

If you answer _Yes_, you will have to describe the product properties.

The product properties are client specific, and have names (keys) which can hold different values. These values can be evaluated by the _opsi-script_ script, and result in installing different options at installation time.

First we have to decide if our property is a text value (_unicode_) or a logical value e.g. true/false (_boolean_). If you are not sure choose _unicode_.


.Choose the data type of the property
image::newprod-property-type.png["Screenshot: Choose the data type of the property", pdfwidth=30%]

Next, a description for the switch needs to be specified.  This description will be shown in the opsi-configed as a help text. Next, you can define the set of values for the switch (separated by comma). If this is left blank, then any value is allowed for the switch.

NOTE: If a values contains a backslash `\` it has to be doubled. +
An example showing how a path would be defined: `C:\\temp`

.Description of the product properties
image::newprod-property-desc.png["Screenshot: Description of the product properties", pdfwidth=40%]

Next, you can decide if the product property has a default value (switch).

.Default value of the product property
image::newprod-property-default.png["Screenshot: Default value of the product property", pdfwidth=40%]

If you choose _boolean_ as the data type, then the description will contain only the _Property name_ and _Property description_.

.Description of a boolean property
image::newprod-property-boolean.png["Screenshot: Description of a boolean property", pdfwidth=60%]

After defining a product property, you will be asked if you want to create another product property. If you choose _Yes_, then the procedure of defining a property will be repeated.  If you choose _No_, then you will be asked for name and email of the product maintainer. This data will be written on the changelog.

.Input of the maintainer data
image::newprod-maintainer.png["Screenshot: Input of the maintainer data", pdfwidth=60%]

Finally, the basic definitions for the new product are done.

Using the list command (`ls`), you can see the directory structure as described above. Change to the `OPSI` folder and list the content. The `control` file now contains the data you just defined, and you can load the file into an editor to view or change the entries.

NOTE: At opsi >= 4.3 `opsi-newprod` will produce a control file in the `.toml` format and a stand-alone `changelog.txt` file.
