[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script]]
== Testing and improving a Script

There are two distinct methods for testing and enhancing a product:

* Test the script you've developed without installing it on the opsi server or deploying it to a client (<<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-standalone>>). 

* Evaluate the entire product by installing it on the server and deploying it to a client (<<opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-integrated>>). 

NOTE: The instructions that follow are based on the assumption that the product you are testing was created using the `opsi-setup-detector`.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-standalone]]
=== Standalone Tests

Start the application `opsi-script-gui`:

* Windows: Double-click to open `opsi-script.exe`. If the client agent is installed on your computer, locate the program at _C:\Program Files (x86)\opsi.org\opsi-client-agent\opsi-script\opsi-script.exe_. Otherwise, manually copy the contents of the `opsi-script\windows\x86\` directory from the `\\<opsiserver>\opsi_depot` share to your Windows computer.

NOTE: On Windows 10, you should right-click the `opsi-script.exe` file in Explorer and choose _Run as administrator_ from the context menu.

* Linux: Start `/opt/opsi-script/opsi-script-gui`.

* macOS: Launch the application via the _/Applications/opsi-script_ menu.

Upon starting the application, you will be presented with the following window:

.Open *opsi-script-gui* in interactive Mode.
image::opsi-script-interactive.png["Open *opsi-script-gui* in interactive Mode.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

Use _Select Script_ to choose the script you're looking to test. Next, click _Start_ to execute the script on your computer. Alternatively, for a syntax check, select _Test_Syntax_. This action checks the script for syntax errors but does not run it on your computer (see the section xref:opsi-script-manual:cli-params.adoc#opsi-script-testsyntax[Checking the Script Syntax]).

To observe how `opsi-script` interprets the script, you can use the `opsi-logviewer`. 

TIP: Adjust the log level using the slider in the bottom right corner of the `opsi-logviewer` to display more or fewer details.

If you need to modify the script, you have a couple of options for editing:

* Open the project in the opsi PackageBuilder and use the editor provided there.
* Alternatively, use a text editor like jEdit that supports `opsi-script` syntax highlighting. This feature is typically included in the basic setup of the opsi products.

.The text editor jEdit supports syntax highlighting for *opsi-script* scripts.
image::jedit-with-winst-script.png["The text editor jEdit supports syntax highlighting for *opsi-script* scripts.", pdfwidth=80%, width=600]

Now, you can save the changes and keep the editor open. Simply switch back to the opsi-script window and click on the _Start_ button again; there's no need to reselect the script. To observe the modifications, refer to the `opsi-logviewer`. You can refresh the log by choosing _Reload_ from the right-click context menu or by clicking the reload button on the toolbar.

To fine-tune your scripts to perfection, you can repeat these steps as needed:

1. Edit and save the script in your text editor.
2. Run the script (again) in `opsi-script`.
3. Check the updated logs to confirm the impact of your changes.

[[opsi-softwintegration-tutorial-create-and-test-script-integrated]]
=== Integrated tests

With the 'integrated tests' the whole project is always executed by opsi on a test client. Proceed as follows:

* Open the script `setup.opsiscript` in an editor and make desired changes (do not forget to save). There are several ways to do this:

** Open the project in _opsi PackageBuilder_ and open the editor from there.

** In principle you can also use any other editor. +
We recommend the editor _jEdit_ with opsi-script syntax highlighting, that you can find in the basic opsi products.

* Product Packing

** Variant 1: Open the project in the _opsi PackageBuilder_ and start the packing via the button _Pack_.

** Variant 2: Login via terminal (e.g. Putty) to the opsi-Server and change to the project directory on the workbench. Pack the product with the command `opsi-makepackage`.

* Install the product on the opsi-server.

** Variant 1: Start the install in the _opsi PackageBuilder_ with the button _install_.

** Variant 2: Start the install in the terminal in the project directory with the command `opsi-package-manager -i <myproctid_version.opsi>`. Where <myproctid_version.opsi> is the filename that was output in the previous step when packing.

* Select and start product via _opsi-configed_

. Select the test client in the tab _Clients_

. In the tab _Product configuration_ select the product. If the product is not visible (which is normal after the first installation) reload the data via the menu _File / Reload all data_ or the button on the very left of the toolbar.

. For the selected product set the action request _setup_ and save.

. Start the client or start it via context menu _on_demand_ if the client is running.

. Wait until the product has run through on the client.

- In the tab _Logfiles / instlog_ inspect the logfile to see how the opsi-script interprets the script. +
Note that you can adjust the log level displayed here with the slider in the lower right hand corner.

* In this way, repetition of the points mentioned: +
 - Adaptation of the script and saving +
 - Pack product +
 - Install product on the server +
 - Run product on the client +
 - check log +
you can gradually customize your scripts to do what you need.

[[opsi-softwintegration-create-opsi-package-makeproductfile]]
== Packing with opsi-makepackage

Afterwards you can pack the product. To do this, go to the root directory of the product and execute `opsi-makepackage`. Now the product will be packed.

It's recommended to create the packages immediately with an associated md5 checksum file.
This file is used by `opsi-package-updater` among others to ensure package integrity after package transfer.
Such a file is created automatically, but for special usage scenarios its creation can be avoided.

When transferring packages on the opsi-Depotserver, 'zsync' can be used to transfer only differences between different packages.
In order to use this method, a special `.zsync` file is needed.
Such a file is created automatically, but for special usage scenarios the creation can be avoided.

If there are space problems in the temporary directory `/tmp` when creating large packages, it's possible to specify an alternate temporary directory using `--temp-directory`.

If a package of this version already exists, `opsi-makepackage` will show a query:

[source,shell]
----
Package file '/var/lib/opsi/workbench/mytest/mytest_3.14-1.opsi' already exists.
Press <O> to overwrite, <C> to abort or <N> to specify a new version:
----

With `o` you can choose to overwrite, with `c` you cancel the process and with `n` you can choose to be asked for a new product or package version.

You can install the packed package on the server with `opsi-package-manager --install <package-file>`

More details about the `opsi-makepackage` can be found in the chapter: xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-makepackage[*opsi-makepackage*]


[[opsi-softwintegration-create-opsi-package-manager]]
== Installing with opsi-package-manager

To install the packed product there is a command `opsi-package-manager` . To do this, go to the root directory of the product and execute the following command.

[source,shell]
----
opsi-package-manager -i <myproductid_version.opsi>
----

More details about the `opsi-package-manager` can be found in the chapter: xref:server:components/commandline.adoc#server-components-opsi-package-manager[*opsi-package-manager*]

[[opsi-softwintegration-tool-opsi-newprod]]
== Create opsi-package with CLI tool opsi-newprod

This is a 'command line tool', intended for the use in text terminals. If you work with a graphical interface, so take a look at: +
link:https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/manual/modules/setup-detector.html[opsi-setup-detector]


CAUTION: Do not use any country-specific symbols (umlaut), since the actual country code might vary for different code tables.


To start creating a new product, change directories to the product directory, and start the creation of the new product by entering the command `opsi-newprod`. The next question will ask you about the type of product you want to create. Choose the type _localboot_ for products which should be installable by _opsi-client-agent_/_opsi-script_. The product type _netboot_ is used for products which are activated as a boot image (like OS installation)

.Choose the product type: localboot
image::newprod-localboot.png["Screenshot: Choose the product type: localboot", pdfwidth=40%]

Confirm your choice with tab (or F12). Next, fill in the basic product parameters. At the top of the window there is an explanation for the current input field.

.Input of the product information
image::newprod-product-info.png["Screenshot: Input of the product information", pdfwidth=40%]

Product Id:: is a distinct short name for the product, independent from the product version (we recommend to use only plain ASCII letters and '-', no white space, no special characters)

Product name:: is the full name of the product

Description:: is an additional description of the product.

Advice:: is some additional information on how to handle the product (a note).

Product version:: is the version of the packed software (max 32 chars).

Package Version:: is the version of the package for the product version. For example, this helps to distinguish between packages with the same product version but with modified _opsi-script_ scripts.

License required:: is only relevant to netboot products.

Priority:: controls the installation sequence. Possible Values are between 100 (at the very beginning) and -100 (at the end). Note: product dependencies also have influence on the installation sequence. See the opsi manual for more information.

After the product information is completed, fill in which action scripts should be provided:

.Input of the opsi-script script names for different actions
image::newprod-script-names.png["Screenshot: Input of the opsi-script script names for different actions", pdfwidth=40%]

After editing the product information you should mention the script you want to use for different activities.

Usually the *+Setup script+* is named `setup.opsiscript`

Usually the *+Uninstall script+* is named `uninstall.opsiscript`

An *+Update-Script+* will be used for minor changes on existing big installations. If this product is switched to the required action _setup_, then the update script will be automatically executed after the setup script.

An *+Always-Script+* will be executed at the beginning of every activity of _opsi-client-agent_ (e.g. on every boot).

A *+Once-Script+* has the resulting state `not_installed`. It is a very special kind of script, and you should only use it if you really know what you are doing.

A *+Custom-Script+* doesn't change the resulting state.  It is a very special kind of script, and you should only use it if you really know what you are doing.

A *+userLoginScript+* is used to modify the user's profile after the user logs into the system. It only works with the opsi extension _User Profile Management_, which is described at the _User Profile Management_ chapter in the opsi-manual.


|=======================
| Type | resulting state | resulting action
| setup | installed | none
| uninstall | not_installed | none
| update | installed | none
| always | installed | always
| once | not_installed | none
| custom | _unchanged_ | _unchangend_
| User login | _unchanged_ | _unchanged_
|=======================

The next step is to define one or more product dependencies. If there are no product dependencies, select _No_.

.Create product dependency: No/Yes
image::newprod-product-new-dependency.png["Screenshot: Create product dependency: No/Yes", pdfwidth=40%]

To create a product dependency, enter the following data (help is available at the top of the window):

.Data needed to create a dependency
image::newprod-product-dependency.png["Screenshot: Data needed to create a dependency", pdfwidth=90%]

Dependency for Action:: Which product action shall the dependency create, or when should the dependency be checked (only setup).

Required product id:: Product id of the required product.

Required action:: Select the required action (_setup_) for the required product. If no _required action_ is set, a _required installation status_ must be set

Required installation status:: Select the required status of the required product (_installed_). So the required product will be installed if it isn't installed on the client yet. If no _required installation status_ is set, a _required action_ must be set

Requirement type:: This is regarding the installation order. If the required product has to be installed before the installation of the actual product, this is set to _before_. If it has to be installed after the actual product, set _requirement type_ to _after_. Leave it blank if the installation order doesn't matter.

NOTE: The possibility to define uninstall actions or dependencies is broken.
After defining a product dependency, you will be asked if you want to create another product dependency. If you choose _Yes_, then the procedure for defining a product dependency is repeated.  If you choose _No_, then you will be asked to define some product properties, which means defining additional  switches for product customization.

NOTE: The installation sequence results from a combination of product dependencies and product priorities. For details on how this is done, and what you can configure, see the opsi-manual.

.A(nother) product property to create?
image::newprod-new-property.png["Screenshot:  A(nother) product property to create?", pdfwidth=40%]

If you answer _Yes_, you will have to describe the product properties.

The product properties are client specific, and have names (keys) which can hold different values. These values can be evaluated by the _opsi-script_ script, and result in installing different options at installation time.

First we have to decide if our property is a text value (_unicode_) or a logical value e.g. true/false (_boolean_). If you are not sure choose _unicode_.


.Choose the data type of the property
image::newprod-property-type.png["Screenshot: Choose the data type of the property", pdfwidth=30%]

Next, a description for the switch needs to be specified.  This description will be shown in the opsi-configed as a help text. Next, you can define the set of values for the switch (separated by comma). If this is left blank, then any value is allowed for the switch.

NOTE: If a values contains a backslash `\` it has to be doubled. +
An example showing how a path would be defined: `C:\\temp`

.Description of the product properties
image::newprod-property-desc.png["Screenshot: Description of the product properties", pdfwidth=40%]

Next, you can decide if the product property has a default value (switch).

.Default value of the product property
image::newprod-property-default.png["Screenshot: Default value of the product property", pdfwidth=40%]

If you choose _boolean_ as the data type, then the description will contain only the _Property name_ and _Property description_.

.Description of a boolean property
image::newprod-property-boolean.png["Screenshot: Description of a boolean property", pdfwidth=60%]

After defining a product property, you will be asked if you want to create another product property. If you choose _Yes_, then the procedure of defining a property will be repeated.  If you choose _No_, then you will be asked for name and email of the product maintainer. This data will be written on the changelog.

.Input of the maintainer data
image::newprod-maintainer.png["Screenshot: Input of the maintainer data", pdfwidth=60%]

Finally, the basic definitions for the new product are done.

Using the list command (`ls`), you can see the directory structure as described above. Change to the `OPSI` folder and list the content. The `control` file now contains the data you just defined, and you can load the file into an editor to view or change the entries.

NOTE: At opsi >= 4.3 `opsi-newprod` will produce a control file in the `.toml` format and a stand-alone `changelog.txt` file.
