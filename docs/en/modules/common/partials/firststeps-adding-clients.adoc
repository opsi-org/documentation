= Adding new Clients 

You can also use opsi to install an operating system on new clients and subsequently integrate them. In this approach, the required client agent is installed automatically.

The following sections describe various methods of creating a client in opsi: via the graphical management interface `opsi-configed`, on the command line, and with our boot CD. After creating a client, you can then use opsi to install a new operating system on it.

== Graphical Management Interface

To add a new client to the opsi server via the management interface `opsi-configed`, select _Client_ / _Create a new opsi client_ from the menu and enter the following information:

* Client name
* DNS domain (if it's different from the default)
* Client description
* IP address (required if DNS can not be used to resolve the client's address)
* MAC address (required if the opsi server is the DHCP server or if you want to use PXE boot with this client)

Once you have confirmed everything, the client is registered with the opsi server. If the opsi server also functions as a DHCP server, the client is additionally set up as a PXE client in the DHCP configuration.

TIP: You can view the list of configured opsi clients at any time in _Client Configuration_ mode on the _Clients_ tab.

[[firststeps-osinstall-create-client-commandline]]
== Command Line

You can also use the `opsi-cli` tool on the command line to create a new client. The general syntax looks like this:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_createOpsiClient <client-id> [opsiHostKey] [description] [notes] [hardwareAddress] [ipAddress] [inventoryNumber] [oneTimePassword] [created] [lastSeen]
----

If you omit any of the optional values in the call, default values are used; as a result, most of the fields will then be empty.

**Example:** The following `opsi-cli` command creates the client `testclient.domain.local` with a random host key, the description `testclient`, without notes, with the MAC address `00:0c:29:12:34:56`, and the IP address `192.0.2.1`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_createOpsiClient testclient.domain.local "null" "testclient" "" 00:0c:29:12:34:56 192.0.2.1
----

[[firststeps-osinstall-create-client-bootcd]]
== Boot CD

You can find an ISO image of the boot CD on the link:https://tools.43.opsi.org/[opsi Tools] website. Download the image and burn it to a CD. Then, boot the computer from this CD. The installer will welcome you with the following boot menu:

.The Boot CD shows the following Boot Menu.
image::opsi-client-boot-cd.png["The Boot CD shows the following Boot Menu.", pdfwidth=90%]

Select _Start opsi (english)_ and press the [Enter] key. After a while, a dialog box will appear in which you should enter the IP address of the client, the network mask, the hostname, the domain name, the gateway, the DNS server, and the IP address of the opsi config server (optional). If your DHCP server assigns IP addresses to unknown computers, some of these fields may already show valid values.

Use the [Tab] key to navigate to the _OK_ option and then press [Enter].

.How should the client register with the opsi server?

Select _Admin account_ to enable the client to log on to the opsi server and create itself. This process will be authorized in the following step.

.Authenticate on the opsi server.

Enter the username and password for an account that is a member of the `opsiadmin` group (refer to chapter xref:server:components/authorization.adoc[Authorizations] for details). Upon successful login, the client will automatically transmit its data to the server, creating its record. You'll then see a list of available Netboot products. Select the desired products for installation using the space bar.

.Select a Netboot Product for Installation

You can now choose either the operating system you wish to install or opt for hardware inventory.
