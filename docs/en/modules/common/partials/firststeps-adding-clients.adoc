== Adding clients to opsi

To be able to manage computers with opsi, they must be known to the opsi system.
In addition, an agent must be running on these computers so that communication between the server and client is possible.
No management is possible without this client agent.

Depending on the environment in which opsi is to be used, there are different procedures.
If there are already clients in the environment with an installed operating system that are to be managed with opsi, they can be integrated in
xref:add-new-clients[different ways].

////
ifdef::getstarted[xref:adding-clients.adoc#firststeps-software-deployment-client-integration[different ways]].
////

The alternative to this is that the computers to be managed by opsi are equipped with a new operating system.
As part of the installation of the operating system, the required agent is also installed by opsi. However, any previously installed software (including the operating system) will be removed.
To use this procedure you first add a xref:add-new-clients[client to opsi] and then perform an xref:clients:windows-client/os-installation.adoc#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall[OS installation].

=== Creation of a new opsi client

To manage computers, they must be known to the {opsi-Server}.
This chapter describes different ways to create a client in opsi for later management.
This is particularly helpful if you want to install an xref:clients:windows-client/os-installation.adoc#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall[operating system] on your computer using opsi.

For the integration of clients with an already installed operating system, please read xref:clients:windows-client/os-installation.adoc#opsi-getting-started-firststeps-osinstall[the chapter integration of existing Clients].

==== Creating a new opsi client via the graphical management interface

A client can be added to the {opsi-Server} through the opsi-configed graphical user interface.

From the menu, choose _OpsiClient / Create new opsi client_ and enter:

* Client name
* DNS domain (if different from the default)
* Client description
* IP address (required if DNS can not be used resolve the address of the client)
* MAC address (required if the {opsi-Server} is the DHCP server or if you want to use PXE boot with this client)

After completing the input, the client will be created on the {opsi-Server}, and if the {opsi-Server} is also the DHCP server, the client will also be created in the DHCP configuration, as a PXE client.

The list of configured opsi clients can be viewed at any time in the opsi-configed mode _Client configuration_ under the _clients_ tab.

[[firststeps-osinstall-create-client-commandline]]
==== Creating a new opsi client via the command line

A client can added through the command line using the tool `opsi-cli`.

The syntax is the following:
[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_createOpsiClient <client-id> [opsiHostKey] [description] [notes] [hardwareAddress] [ipAddress] [inventoryNumber] [oneTimePassword] [created] [lastSeen]
----

Missing values usually use a default value - most fields are then empty.


The following command will create the client `testclient.domain.local` with a random host key,
the description `Testclient`, no notes, the MAC address of `00:0c:29:12:34:56` and the IP address `192.0.2.1`:

[source,console]
----
opsi-cli jsonrpc execute host_createOpsiClient testclient.domain.local "null" "Testclient" "" 00:0c:29:12:34:56 192.0.2.1
----

==== Creating a new opsi client using the opsi-client-bootcd

On the download page of uib you will find various ISO images of the 'opsi-client-boot-cd' at link:https://download.uib.de/opsi4.2/boot-cd/[].
Download the latest and burn it to a CD.

Start the computer from the CD.
You then should see the following screen:

.Start image opsi-client-boot-cd
image::opsi-client-boot-cd.png["Screenshot: Start image opsi-client-boot-cd", pdfwidth=90%]

Choose _Start opsi (English)_. After a while, the following screen will appear. If your DHCP server assigns IP addresses to unknown DHCP clients, then most fields will already have valid values. Otherwise you have to complete the missing data by hand. You must at least give the hostname.

.bootimage/boot-cd configuration screen
image::boot-cd-config.png["Screenshot: bootimage/boot-cd configuration screen", pdfwidth=90%]

Then choose _OK_.

.bootimage/boot-cd:  Choose how to create Client
image::boot-cd-select.png["Screenshot: bootimage/boot-cd:  Choose how to create Client", pdfwidth=50%]

Then choose _Admin account_. This tells the client to register itself at the opsi-Server using provided credentials.

.bootimage / boot-cd: Authenticate as member of opsiadmin group
image::boot-cd-authent.png["Screenshot: bootimage / boot-cd: Authenticate as member of opsiadmin group", pdfwidth=90%]

Now you will get a login window, where you must authenticate yourself as a member of the opsiadmin group. If this was successful, then the client sends its data to the server, at which point the client will be created at the server. In the next step, the client asks the server for the list of available netboot products, and makes them available for you to choose from.

.bootimage/boot-cd: netboot product list
image::boot-cd-product.png["Screenshot: bootimage/boot-cd: netboot product list", pdfwidth=50%]

ifndef::macosclientmanual[]
Now you may choose the operating system that you would like to install (or e.g. xref:clients:windows-client/rollout-products.adoc#firststeps-software-deployment-product-tests-inventory[hwinvent]).
