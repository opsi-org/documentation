=== Analyzing File & Creating the Package

The following sections describe how to analyze a setup file and create an opsi product from it. To do this, click the _Analyze File and Create opsi Package_ button on the start page (<<osd_page_start>>). Then navigate to the desired `.exe` or `.msi` file in the file selection dialog. The `opsi-setup-detector` starts the analysis immediately.

[[opsi-setup-detector-use-single-analyze]]
==== Analysis

After successfully analyzing a setup file, you will see this dialog:

.The *opsi-setup-detector* has successfully analyzed a File.
image::osd_page_analyze_en.png["The *opsi-setup-detector* has successfully analyzed a File.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

If the analysis was not successful, you will see this dialog instead:

.The *Sorry Unknown Installer* Dialog
image::osd_unknown_select_installer_en.png["The *Sorry Unknown Installer* Dialog", pdfwidth=30%]

Now, you have the option to either terminate the process by clicking on _Cancel_ or to proceed with the analysis by selecting an installer type from the drop-down menu.

Should the analysis prove successful, a window might pop up providing additional details about the identified installer type. This informational window is typical for installer types like InstallShield, Qt Installer, or InstallAnywhere.

image::osd_installer_info_installshield_en.png["Additional Info: InstallShield", pdfwidth=90%]

image::osd_installer_info_QT_en.png["Additional Info: Qt Installer", pdfwidth=90%]

image::osd_installer_info_anywhere_en.png["Additional Info: InstallAnywhere", pdfwidth=90%]

If the analysis has been successful, the `opsi-setup-detector` will display the result:

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-use-single-setup-data]]
.This Tab shows the Result of a successful Analysis.
image::osd_page_setup1_en.png["This Tab shows the Result of a successful Analysis.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

On the _1. Setup_ tab, you will find detailed information and various functions as follows:

* _Detected Setup type_: Type of installer detected

* _Prefer Silent Install_: Activate this checkbox to prefer a silent installation to an unattended installation (if possible).

* _MST allowed_: Should additional `mst` files be used to customize the settings for Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) applications?

* _Info_: Link with further information about the installer

* _Setup File_: Path and name of the analyzed setup file

* _MST File_: To specify the MST file to be integrated into the MSI call

* _MsiId_: Product code for MSI installers or installers that contain MSI

* _MsiName_: Product name for MSI installers or installers that contain MSI; stored in the registry as _DisplayName_.

* _Software version_: Version of the software to be installed (if this can be determined)

* _Setup file size MB_: Size of the setup file in MB

* _Required Space MB_: Estimated value (size of the setup file times 6), can be adjusted if necessary

* _InstallDir_: Directory where the software will be installed, assuming it is correctly identified. If the installation directory is not accurately recognized, you can manually specify the correct directory by clicking the folder icon next to this field to open a file selection dialog. Standard paths like `C:\program Files` or `C:\program Files (x86)` are automatically substituted with the relevant `opsi-script` constants, such as `%ProgramFiles32Dir%`.

* _Install Command_: This represents the command determined for a non-interactive installation. The specifics of this command vary depending on whether the _Prefer Silent Install_ checkbox is selected.

* _Uninstall Command_: The command determined for a non-interactive uninstallation. The specifics of this command vary depending on whether the _Prefer Silent Install_ checkbox is selected.

* _Uninstall Program_: Program detected for uninstallation; if not detected correctly, you can open a file selection dialog via the folder icon next to the field and navigate to the desired application. *MSI files do not (usually) have an uninstall program.*

* _Target Program_: Main executable of the software being installed. It's commonly used for creating desktop shortcuts or start menu entries. The main program is not automatically determined. If the software is already installed on the computer, you can select the executable file using the folder icon to open a selection dialog.

After the analysis is complete, any values that have been determined can be adjusted or supplemented as needed. Once you have made any necessary changes, click on the _Next Step_ button to proceed to the first tab of the product configuration.

WARNING: There is a high probability that the values obtained from the analysis might be incomplete or partially incorrect. After conducting an initial installation, it is crucial to thoroughly review and verify the accuracy of values such as _InstallDir_, _Uninstall Program_, _Target Program_, and _Software Version_ in your script!

==== Product Configuration 1

Make the following settings on this tab:

.Configure the opsi Product.
image::osd_page_product1_en.png["Configure the opsi Product.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

* _opsi Product ID_: This is the identifier for the new opsi package, generated from the product name specified in the _opsi Product Name_ field. Spaces and special characters in the product name are replaced with hyphens. You can modify the suggested product ID.

* _Import control File_: Click on this button to open a file selection dialog allowing you to import data from an existing `control` file (`control, control.toml`) into your current project. Note that information like version numbers, script names, or required disk space is not imported.

* _opsi Product Name_: This field allows you to correct or adjust the name of the software that is being installed.

* _Product Version_: Here, you can correct the version number that was determined from the setup file's name. It should only include digits and periods, as it is used for the versioning of the opsi package.

* _Package Version_: This version number differentiates between opsi products that contain the same software version but may have varying scripts or properties. Like the product version, it should only contain digits and periods.

* _Description_: In this field, provide a brief description of the application. With opsi 4.3 and later, this text can be formatted using Markdown. An editing area is provided on the left side and a preview on the right.

* _Advice_: Provide extra details about the software, such as its origin, download link, licensing information, etc. Starting with opsi 4.3, this text can be formatted using Markdown. An editing area is provided on the left side and a preview on the right.

* _Template Channel_: Choose from the following templates in the drop-down menu to generate the scripts:

  - _default_: Serves as the standard and fallback option. If another selected template does not provide the necessary files for your project, _default_ will be automatically employed. Key scripts of the product include: `setup.opsiscript`, `uninstall.opsiscript`, `declarations.opsiinc`, `sections.opsiinc`, and `delinc.opsiinc`.

  - _training_: Offers a simple structure with detailed comments; key scripts for the product are `setup.opsiscript`, `uninstall.opsiscript`, and `delinc.opsiinc`.

  - _structured_: Defaults to _default_; not useed in version 4.2.2 and above.

  - _custom_: Initially empty, this template provides space for your own template files. To use custom templates, copy them to the `opsi-setup-detector/custom/template-files/` directory on the depot server, and then reinstall the `opsi-setup-detector` on the relevant clients.

At the bottom of the window, there are several checkboxes that allow you to integrate additional code and settings for specific purposes:

* _Support custom directory_: This option adds an extra directory named `custom` to the product, which can hold (customer-specific) customizations. When a new version of the package is installed on the server, this `custom` directory will not be overwritten. The included code provides templates to include files from this directory (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-support_custom_directory[Custom Directory]). 

* _Install from local temp dir_: With this option, the installation files are initially copied to a local, temporary directory and installed from there. This approach is especially beneficial for components that might disrupt the network connection during installation, such as drivers (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-install_from_local_temp_dir[Local, temporary Directory]). 

* _Handle License Key_: This option generates an additional property dedicated to managing license keys (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-handle_license_key[License Key]). 

* _DesktopIcon_: This creates an additional boolean property (defaulted to `false`) to manage the creation of desktop icons (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-desktopicon[Desktop Icon]). 

* _Customize Profile_: This option includes a `ProfileActions` section in the code, allowing for customizations in local user profiles. For an in-depth explanation, refer to the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-customize_profile[Customize local User Profiles].

[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-priority_dependency]]
==== Priority and Dependencies

You can define priorities and dependencies more precisely on the _Product Configuration 2_ tab:

.Configure Priority and Dependencies.
image::osd_page_product2_en.png["Configure Priority and Dependencies.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

NOTE: For "standard" application software, it's usually unnecessary to configure anything in this section, and you can proceed by clicking on _Next Step_.

The following settings can be adjusted on this tab:

* _Priority_: This setting affects the installation order. Possible values range from 100 (indicating early installation) to -100 (signifying late installation). *For application software, a priority of 0 is generally recommended.* Note that the installation order can also be influenced by dependencies between products.

* _Dependencies_: This area allows you to specify dependencies among products. If your opsi server's access credentials are saved in the configuration, the tool will attempt to connect to the server. If the password hasn't been stored for security reasons, a password prompt will appear at this stage (see the section <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-dependency-config>>).

image::osd_password_dlg_en.png["Password Dialog", pdfwidth=40%]

* _Properties_: Here you can define variable properties of the producti (see the section  <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-properties-config>>).

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-dependency-config]]
===== Defining Dependencies

Click the button _Add Dependency_ to open the _Depency Editor_:

.You can configure Dependencies in this Dialog.
image::osd_dependency_editor.png["You can configure Dependencies in this Dialog.", pdfwidth=40%]

Here you can make the following settings:

* _create dependency for which action request_: The default selection here is _setup_. Starting with opsi 4.3, other action requests are also supported, including `uninstall`, `update`, `always`, `custom`, and `once`. Exercise caution with this setting to avoid creating unsolvable or contradictory conditions!

NOTE: This drop-down menu is only active if the _dependencies_for_all_actionrequests_ option has been enabled in the `opsi-setup-detector` configuration (refer to section <<opsi-setup-detector-use-start>> for more details).

* _productid of the dependent product_: Through the drop-down menu, you can select the product that has a dependency. If there's an active connection to the opsi server, the dialog will indicate this in green and will list the installed products. If the connection is not established, a red message will appear, and you'll need to manually enter the product ID.

* _Require Mode_: This setting is disabled when creating a meta product to prevent illogical configurations. There are two selectable options in this area:

  - _Action_: This option requests an ActionRequest (like _setup_) to be set for the product with which there is a dependency.
  - _State_: This refers to the product's state that has a dependency (such as _installed_). If the status is different, the product is set to _setup_.

NOTE: The actual order of installation is determined by a combination of the dependencies and the priority assigned to the products (see the section xref:opsi-products:localboot-products.adoc#opsi-manual-localboot-product-order[Dependencies and Order]). 

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-properties-config]]
===== Defining Propertys

On the _Product Configuration 2_ tab, you can define modifiable  properties (variables) for the product. To do this, simply click on the _Add Property_ button:

.You can configure Product Properties in this dialog.
image::osd_property-editor.png["You can configure Product Properties in this dialog.", pdfwidth=40%]

[cols="8,15,27"]

[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-icon]]
==== Selecting Product Icon

On this tab, you can select an icon for the product that will be displayed during installation:

.Select an Icon for your Product.
image::osd_page_producticon_en.png["Select an Icon for your Product.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

NOTE: Should you decide to skip this optional step, the `opsi-setup-detector` will default to selecting an icon with gears and automatically proceed to the next tab.

To select a different icon, click on the _open icon folder_ button located on the right side of the windowi to open a selection dialog where you can navigate to the folder containing your preferred icons. Initially, you will be directed to the _128x128_ folder, which includes a variety of icons provided with the `opsi-setup-detector` under a free license. Once you open this folder, all available icons will be displayed on the left side of the window, allowing you to choose one for your product.

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-product-create]]
==== Creating the Product

After you have finished configuring the product, you can proceed to create it using the options provided on the last tab.

.Create the Product on the last Tab.
image::osd_page_create_en.png["Create the Product on the last Tab.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

The following options are available on this tab:

* _Path to opsi-work-bench_: Displays the directory you configured during setup for the workbench share on your opsi server. This can be either a drive letter or a UNC path.

* _Check workbench path_ button: Use this to verify whether the workbench share is accessible.

* _Create mode_: Choose how the package should be created:
  - _create opsi product files_: This option will create (if not already existing) the directory structure for the new opsi product on the workbench. It also generates or copies the necessary files for the package.
  - _create opsi product files and build package_: In addition to creating the directory structure, this option attempts to build the package on the opsi server. If the _build and install_ checkbox is selected in the _Build Mode_ area on the right, the product will be installed on the server after being built. If the connection to the opsi web service is configured, the service is contacted, and if necessary, it will prompt for the password.

NOTE: The building and installation process via the web service only works if the `opsiconfd` is of version 4.2.0.287 or newer. If the service is either unavailable or outdated, the opsi PackageBuilder (non-GUI version) will step in to create the package.

  - _create opsi product files and start the interactive PackageBuilder_ creates the directory tree for the new opsi product (if it doesn't exist on the workbench) and starts the opsi PackageBuilder in an interactive mode. You need to exit this application explicitly to return to the `opsi-setup-detector`.

* _Build Mode_: There are two options here, which define the actions performed when you select _Create opsi Package_:

  - _build_: This option solely creates the opsi package, similar to the `opsi-makepackage` command.

  - _build and install_: This option not only creates the opsi package (`opsi-makepackage`) but also installs it, equivalent to the command `opsi-package-manager --install <package>`.

* _Create opsi Package_: Click on this button to start the build process. If there is an opsi product with the same name, you will see the following dialog:

image::osd_overwrite_dlg_en.png["Backup Dialog", pdfwidth=40%]

* _Rebuild Package only_: This button initiates the building of the opsi package without re-generating the opsi files first. Hence, it's a convenient option for rebuilding a package after making modifications to the script in an external editor.

During the creation of the opsi product, the `opsi-setup-detector` records all the information you've entered into a file named `opsi-project.osd`, located in the root directory of the product.

TIP: At a later stage, you can reopen an `opsi-project.osd` file with the `opsi-setup-detector` if you need to make adjustments to an already existing package.

[[opsi-setup-detector-product-reopen]]
=== Opening an existing Project

To open an existing project structure as a project with the `opsi-setup-detector`, there are two approaches:

* For products created with the `opsi-setup-detector`: Navigate to the _File_ menu, then select _Open_, and select the `opsi-project.osd` file located in the root directory of the project.

* For products *not* created with the `opsi-setup-detector`: Open the `control` file (either `control` or `control.toml`) via the menu entry _File_ / _Open Control File_. It's located in the `OPSI` directory of the product.

The second method provides less comprehensive information, particularly regarding the setup file used by the installer.
