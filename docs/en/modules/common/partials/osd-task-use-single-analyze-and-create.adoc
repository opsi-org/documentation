=== Analyzing File and Creating the Package

The following sections describe how to analyze a setup file and create an opsi product from it. To do this, click the _Analyze File and Create Opsi Package_ button on the start page (<<osd_page_start>>). Then navigate to the desired `.exe` or `.msi` file in the file selection dialog. The `opsi-setup-detector` starts the analysis immediately.

[[opsi-setup-detector-use-single-analyze]]
=== Analysis

After successfully analyzing a setup file, you will see this dialog:

.The *opsi-setup-detector* has successfully analyzed a File.
image::osd_page_analyze_en.png["The *opsi-setup-detector* has successfully analyzed a File.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

If the analysis was not successful, you will see this dialog instead:

.The *Sorry Unknown Installer* Dialog
image::osd_unknown_select_installer_en.png["The *Sorry Unknown Installer* Dialog", pdfwidth=30%]

Now, you have the option to either terminate the process by clicking on _Cancel_ or to proceed with the analysis by selecting an installer type from the drop-down menu.

Should the analysis prove successful, a window might pop up providing additional details about the identified installer type. This informational window is typical for installer types like InstallShield, Qt Installer, or InstallAnywhere.

image::osd_installer_info_installshield_en.png["Additional Info: InstallShield", pdfwidth=90%]

image::osd_installer_info_QT_en.png["Additional Info: Qt Installer", pdfwidth=90%]

image::osd_installer_info_anywhere_en.png["Additional Info: InstallAnywhere", pdfwidth=90%]

If the analysis has been successful, the `opsi-setup-detector` will display the result:

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-use-single-setup-data]]
.This Tab shows the Result of a successful Analysis.
image::osd_page_setup1_en.png["This Tab shows the Result of a successful Analysis.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

On the _1. Setup_ tab, you will find detailed information and various functions as follows:

* _Detected Setup type_: Type of installer detected

* _Prefer Silent Install_: Activate this checkbox to prefer a silent installation to an unattended installation (if possible).

* _MST allowed_: Should additional `mst` files be used to customize the settings for Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) applications?

* _Info_: Link with further information about the installer

* _Setup File_: Path and name of the analyzed setup file

* _MST File_: To specify the MST file to be integrated into the MSI call

* _MsiId_: Product code for MSI installers or installers that contain MSI

* _MsiName_: Product name for MSI installers or installers that contain MSI; stored in the registry as _DisplayName_.

* _Software version_: Version of the software to be installed (if this can be determined)

* _Setup file size MB_: Size of the setup file in MB

* _Required Space MB_: Estimated value (size of the setup file times 6), can be adjusted if necessary

* _InstallDir_: Directory where the software will be installed, assuming it is correctly identified. If the installation directory is not accurately recognized, you can manually specify the correct directory by clicking the folder icon next to this field to open a file selection dialog. Standard paths like `C:\program Files` or `C:\program Files (x86)` are automatically substituted with the relevant `opsi-script` constants, such as `%ProgramFiles32Dir%`.

* _Install Command_: This represents the command determined for a non-interactive installation. The specifics of this command vary depending on whether the _Prefer Silent Install_ checkbox is selected.

* _Uninstall Command_: The command determined for a non-interactive uninstallation. The specifics of this command vary depending on whether the _Prefer Silent Install_ checkbox is selected.

* _Uninstall Program_: Program detected for uninstallation; if not detected correctly, you can open a file selection dialog via the folder icon next to the field and navigate to the desired application. *MSI files do not (usually) have an uninstall program.*

* _Target Program_: Main executable of the software being installed. It's commonly used for creating desktop shortcuts or start menu entries. The main program is not automatically determined. If the software is already installed on the computer, you can select the executable file using the folder icon to open a selection dialog.

After the analysis is complete, any values that have been determined can be adjusted or supplemented as needed. Once you have made any necessary changes, click on the _Next Step_ button to proceed to the first tab of the product configuration.

CAUTION: There is a high probability that the values obtained from the analysis might be incomplete or partially incorrect. After conducting an initial installation, it is crucial to thoroughly review and verify the accuracy of values such as _InstallDir_, _Uninstall Program_, _Target Program_, and _Software Version_ in your script!

[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration1]]
==== Product Configuration 1

Make the following settings on this tab:

.Configure the opsi Product.
image::osd_page_product1_en.png["Configure the opsi Product.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

* _opsi Product ID_: This is the identifier for the new opsi package, generated from the product name specified in the _opsi Product Name_ field. Spaces and special characters in the product name are replaced with hyphens. You can modify the suggested product ID.

* _Import control File_: Click on this button to open a file selection dialog allowing you to import data from an existing `control` file (`control, control.toml`) into your current project. Note that information like version numbers, script names, or required disk space is not imported.

* _opsi Product Name_: This field allows you to correct or adjust the name of the software that is being installed.

* _Product Version_: Here, you can correct the version number that was determined from the setup file's name. It should only include digits and periods, as it is used for the versioning of the opsi package.

* _Package Version_: This version number differentiates between opsi products that contain the same software version but may have varying scripts or properties. Like the product version, it should only contain digits and periods.

* _Description_: In this field, provide a brief description of the application. With opsi 4.3 and later, this text can be formatted using Markdown. An editing area is provided on the left side and a preview on the right.

* _Advice_: Provide extra details about the software, such as its origin, download link, licensing information, etc. Starting with opsi 4.3, this text can be formatted using Markdown. An editing area is provided on the left side and a preview on the right.

* _Template Channel_: Choose from the following templates in the drop-down menu to generate the scripts:

  - _default_: Serves as the standard and fallback option. If another selected template does not provide the necessary files for your project, _default_ will be automatically employed. Key scripts of the product include: `setup.opsiscript`, `uninstall.opsiscript`, `declarations.opsiinc`, `sections.opsiinc`, and `delinc.opsiinc`.

  - _training_: Offers a simple structure with detailed comments; key scripts for the product are `setup.opsiscript`, `uninstall.opsiscript`, and `delinc.opsiinc`.

  - _structured_: Defaults to _default_; not useed in version 4.2.2 and above.

  - _custom_: Initially empty, this template provides space for your own template files. To use custom templates, copy them to the `opsi-setup-detector/custom/template-files/` directory on the depot server, and then reinstall the `opsi-setup-detector` on the relevant clients.

At the bottom of the window, there are several checkboxes that allow you to integrate additional code and settings for specific purposes:

* _Support custom directory_: This option adds an extra directory named `custom` to the product, which can hold (customer-specific) customizations. When a new version of the package is installed on the server, this `custom` directory will not be overwritten. The included code provides templates to include files from this directory (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-support_custom_directory[*opsi-setup-detector*: Custom Directory]). 

* _Install from local temp dir_: With this option, the installation files are initially copied to a local, temporary directory and installed from there. This approach is especially beneficial for components that might disrupt the network connection during installation, such as drivers (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-install_from_local_temp_dir[*opsi-setup-detector*: Loca, temporary Directory]). 

* _Handle License Key_: This option generates an additional property dedicated to managing license keys (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-handle_license_key[*opsi-setup-detector*: License Key]). 

* _DesktopIcon_: This creates an additional boolean property (defaulted to `false`) to manage the creation of desktop icons (see the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-desktopicon[*opsi-setup-detector*: Desktop Icon]). 

* _Customize Profile_: This option includes a `ProfileActions` section in the code, allowing for customizations in local user profiles. For an in-depth explanation, refer to the section xref:clients:windows-client/softwareintegration.adoc#opsi-setup-detector-customize_profile[*opsi-setup-detector*: Customize local User Profiles].

[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-priority_dependency]]
==== Priority and Dependencies

You can define priorities and dependencies more precisely on the _Product Configuration 2_ tab:

.Configure Priority and Dependencies.
image::osd_page_product2_en.png["Configure Priority and Dependencies.", pdfwidth=80%, width=800]

NOTE: For "standard" application software, it's usually unnecessary to configure anything in this section, and you can proceed by clicking on _Next Step_.

The following settings can be adjusted on this tab:

* _Priority_: This setting affects the installation order. Possible values range from 100 (indicating early installation) to -100 (signifying late installation). *For application software, a priority of 0 is generally recommended.* Note that the installation order can also be influenced by dependencies between products.

* _Dependencies_: This area allows you to specify dependencies among products. If your opsi server's access credentials are saved in the configuration, the tool will attempt to connect to the server. If the password hasn't been stored for security reasons, a password prompt will appear at this stage (see the section <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-dependency-config>>).

image::osd_password_dlg_en.png["Password Dialog", pdfwidth=40%]

* _Properties_: Here you can define variable properties of the producti (see the section  <<opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-properties-config>>).

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-product-configuration-dependency-config]]
===== Defining Dependencies

Click the button _Add Dependency_ to open the _Depency Editor_:

.You can configure Dependencies in this Dialog.
image::osd_dependency_editor.png["You can configure Dependencies in this Dialog.", pdfwidth=40%]

Here you can make the following settings:

* _create dependency for which action request_: The default selection here is _setup_. Starting with opsi 4.3, other action requests are also supported, including `uninstall`, `update`, `always`, `custom`, and `once`. Exercise caution with this setting to avoid creating unsolvable or contradictory conditions!

NOTE: This drop-down menu is only active if the _dependencies_for_all_actionrequests_ option has been enabled in the `opsi-setup-detector` configuration (refer to section <<opsi-setup-detector-use-start>> for more details).

* _productid of the dependent product_: Through the drop-down menu, you can select the product that has a dependency. If there's an active connection to the opsi server, the dialog will indicate this in green and will list the installed products. If the connection is not established, a red message will appear, and you'll need to manually enter the product ID.

* _Require Mode_: This setting is disabled when creating a meta product to prevent illogical configurations. There are two selectable options in this area:

  - _Action_: This option requests an ActionRequest (like _setup_) to be set for the product with which there is a dependency.
  - _State_: This refers to the product's state that has a dependency (such as _installed_). If the status is different, the product is set to _setup_.

NOTE: The actual order of installation is determined by a combination of the dependencies and the priority assigned to the products (see the section xref:opsi-products:localboot-products.adoc#opsi-manual-localboot-product-order[Dependencies and Order]).

=== opsi-setup-detector: Product Icon

.opsi-setup-detector: Produkt Icon
image::osd_page_producticon_en.png["Product Icon", pdfwidth=90%]

Here you can select an icon to be displayed during the installation or you can accept the default icon (cogwheel) with _Next step_ and switch to the next tab... +


To select another icon, use the button _Open icon directory_ to select the directory in which you expect to find icons. As a preselection you get a directory of 'open source' icons: 128x128, supplied with the _opsi-setup-detector_. Select a subdirectory and the icons will be displayed. +
Now you can select an icon from the display.

After the product configuration is performed, the product can be created.

// This is jump target for the opsi-setup-detector online help
[[opsi-setup-detector-product-create]]
=== opsi-setup-detector: Create product


.opsi-setup-detector create product
image::osd_page_create_en.png["Create product", pdfwidth=90%]

* _Path to opsi-workbench_ is a drive letter or UNC path where the share _opsi_workbench_ of your opsi-Server is mounted.

* To the left of the button _Create opsi package_ there are three possible options, which refer to the function of the button:

* _Create Mode_ is a selection area where you can specify what happens when creating the package:

* _Create opsi product files_ creates the directory tree for the new opsi package on the selected _opsi workbench_ if it does not already exist. The files required for the package will be created or copied.

* _Create opsi product files and build package_ performs the operations described in the first point. +
Additionally, we try to build and perhaps install the package on the opsi server. +
If we have the connection data to the opsi web service (see also: link:https://docs.opsi.org/opsi-docs-en/4.2/windows-client-manual/softwareintegration.html#opsi-setup-detector-use-start[Opsi-setup-detector Start and necessary configurations]), we connect the opsi web service. If there is no password stored in the configuration, you will be asked for the service password. If the version of the opsi web service is 4.2.0.287 or higher, we use the opsi web service to do this task. +
If we can not connect to the opsi web service or if the web service is to old, then the _opsi Package Builder_ is called (without GUI) to create the opsi package from the created directory tree and will be terminated if the job is done. +
The exact processes are determined by the selection field _Build Mode_:

** _Only build_ just create the opsi package like calling the server command `opsi-makepackage`.

** _build and install_ create the opsi package like calling the server command `opsi-makepackage`. Afterwards the new package is installed like calling the server command `opsi-package-manager --install <package name>`.

* _Create opsi product files and start interactive package builder_ performs the operations listed in the first item. +
Additionally the _opsi Package Builder_ is called interactively. +
You have to quit it yourself to return to the _opsi-setup-detector_.
For installation, configuration and operation of the community project _opsi Package Builder_ check https://forum.opsi.org/viewforum.php?f=22

* _Create opsi package_ is the button that initiates the package creation. +
If a package with this name already exists, you will be asked if the files in the existing directory should be backuped or deleted:

image::osd_overwrite_dlg_en.png["Backup Dialog", pdfwidth=40%]

If while creating the new product files a existing directory is detected, you will be asked how to handle the old existing files.

* _Rebuild Package only_ is the button that initiates the rebuild of the opsi package (via webservice) without recreating the opsi files. So it can be used to rebuild and install the opsi package after you modified the script via editor without loosing your changes.

While creating the new product files, all given data of the project will be stored in the file `opsi-project.osd` in the base directory of the project. This file may be used later, to reopen the project.

[[opsi-setup-detector-product-reopen]]
=== opsi-setup-detector: Reopen a Project

A existing Project can be reopend by the opsi-setup-detector in two ways:

* If it was created by the opsi-setup-detector, you may use the menue entry: `File / Open Project File`.

* If it was not created by the opsi-setup-detector, you may use the menue entry: `File / Open Control File` to open the file `control` bzw. `control.toml` in the `OPSI` directory of the product. +
In this case you will have less information e.g. about the used installer files.
