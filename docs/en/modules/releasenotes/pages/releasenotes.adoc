[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-important]]
== Important information - please note

opsi 4.2 is an independent release and has its own repositories.
These new repositories have to be added to the system and the repositories of the previous version have to be removed.
Only then can the installation / upgrade be carried out.

For an upgrade from opsi 4.1 the installed packages need to be the latest opsi 4.1 stable versions.
Other packages - such as MySQL server - should also be up-to-date.
Otherwise errors in the upgrade process may occur.

It is also strongly recommended to update the packages 'opsi-winst', 'opsi-client-agent' or 'opsi-linux-client-agent' on all clients to the latest opsi 4.1 versions before upgrading.

=== Python 3
opsi 4.2 is now completely based on Python 3.
Furthermore, all Python-based packages are now distributed as executable binary files.
The 'python-opsi' package is no longer provided as an installable package.
It is therefore important to note the following points:

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-important-reinstall-opsi-packages]]
==== Opsi packages containing server-side Python scripts
After upgrading the server to opsi 4.2, please use 'opsi-package-manager' to reinstall opsi-packages that contain Python scripts running on the server:

* +opsi-client-agent+: `opsi-deploy-client-agent`
* +win*+: `create_driver_links.py`, `show_drivers.py`

The postinst script automatically corrects these scripts and sets the new interpreter to `opsi-python`.

Alternatively, the Python scripts can be corrected manually.
For this, the interpreter must be set to +opsi-python+ (use `#!/usr/bin/opsi-python` as 'shebang').

==== Own Python scripts that use python-opsi (import OPSI)
If scripts are used that depend on python-opsi, the following steps must be carried out:
* Convert these scripts to Python 3 (Python's own `2to3` can be used for this).
* Change the interpreter to `opsi-python`, which provides `python-opsi` (`import OPSI`) (use `#!/usr/bin/opsi-python` as 'shebang').

==== Backend extensions (/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d)
If you have modified the configuration files in `/etc/opsi/backendManager/extend.d` or added new ones, these changes must be checked for Python 3 compatibility and adjusted if necessary.

=== File admin group pcpatch / opsifileadmins.
With opsi 4.2 the default name for the opsi file admin group was changed from 'pcpatch' to 'opsifileadmins'.
However, when upgrading from opsi 4.1, the previously used name will continue to be used.
The name can be customized in the `/etc/opsi/opsi.conf` configuration file via option `fileadmingroup` of the `groups` section.
When changing to the 'opsifileadmins' group, note that the 'pcpatch' user must also be added to this group.

=== opsiconfd configuration and logs
There are some changes in the configuration and the logs of 'opsiconfd'.

* All configuration options are documented in the help text of opsiconfd ('opsiconfd --help').
* These command line parameters can also be used in the configuration file `opsiconfd.conf` (without '--').
* The opsiconfd now has a built-in log rotation. This can be configured with the options 'max-log-size' and 'keep-rotated-logs'.
* The log file 'package.log' is now part of 'opsiconfd.log'.
* The logs now contain context that can be used to filter the logs. For example you can filter these with 'grep' or start opsiconfd with the option '--log-filter LOG_FILTER':

=== Verification of the server identity

Since opsi 4.2, the trustworthiness of the opsi-server can be ensured using standard TLS methods.
Each opsi-config-server maintains a Certificate Authority (CA), the opsi CA. This CA is automatically managed by the
opsi-config-server. Each opsi-server, also the opsi-depot-server receive a TLS certificate from the opsi-config-server,
which is signed by this CA. These certificates are also automatically created, distributed and updated as needed. Any
client that trusts the opsi CA also trusts these server certificates.

This applies especially to the 'verify_server_cert' and 'verify_server_cert_by_ca' options. For more information please refer to the corresponding chapter in the opsi-manual.

=== Depraction of opsi4ucs package

With opsi 4.2 the ucs support was adepted to the opsi-standard like on other supported distibutions. The function of opsi4ucs was implemented in opsi-server package and its variants.
The opsi4ucs package exists in opsi 4.2 as a transitionpackage to make the migration easier. This package will automatically removed during the upgrade process.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation]]
== Installation instructions

We strongly suggest to create a backup of the backends with {opsi-backup} before upgrading:
[source,prompt]
----
opsi-backup create
----

All opsi components that are published in this release depend on each other in many places.
Therefore all components should be upgraded.

We recommend to first upgrade the server, and then update the opsi packages (products).

In a multi-depot environment, it is recommended to upgrade the config server first before upgrading the depots.

We recommend running `opsi-setup --set-rights` after the update to ensure that access rights are set correctly.
This command can take several minutes to complete.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-systempackages]]
=== Advice for updating the operating system packages

Please make sure that you are using the latest opsi 4.1 packages from the stable branch at the time of the upgrade!


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-opsipackages]]
=== Notes on updating opsi-packages

Usually, opsi packages are compatible with both opsi 4.1 and opsi 4.2.

The official opsi 4.2 repositories on _download.uib.de_ contain packages which are compatible with opsi 4.1.
Please note that these packages do not necessarily have to specify `4.2` as the version in order to be compatible.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration]]
=== Migration of an opsi 4.1 server

On supported operating systems it is possible to migrate an existing opsi 4.1 installation to opsi 4.2.

If the opsi servers are managed with opsi, the migration can be done with the package `l-opsi-server-migrate`.

NOTE: Upgrading from opsi 4.0 directly to opsi 4.2 is not supported. In such a case an upgrade to opsi 4.1 has to be carried out before an upgrade to opsi 4.2 is possible.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-prerequired]]
==== Requirements for a migration

From version 4.2 the opsi-server needs access to a Redis and a Grafana instance.
If these services will also be provided by the opsi server, we recommend switching to the 'opsi-server-full' package during the migration. This package installs and configures everything that is necessary on the opsi server (this will be referred to as a single server setup).

The Grafana repositories are required for the installation of Grafana:

===== Debian/Ubuntu:

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-migrate]]
==== Upgrading the operating system packages

After adding the new package sources, the system can be migrated.

IMPORTANT: The default ACLs (`/etc/opsi/backendManager/acl.conf`) were changed in opsi 4.2 for security reasons.
We therefore urgently recommend using the new version of the configuration file.

IMPORTANT: With RPM-based distributions, existing configuration files are replaced with new ones as part of the migration. Please refer to the information for the relevant distributions.

----

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-opsi-packages]]
==== Updating the opsi packages

The last step is to update to the latest opsi packages.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-opsi-packages-standard]]
===== Using the default configuration

If you have not made any changes to the standard configuration in `/etc/opsi/package-updater.repos.d/`, you can update the opsi packages directly using this command:

[source, prompt]
----
opsi-package-updater -v update
----

==== Opsi packages that contain server-side Python scripts
Please reinstall opsi packages that contain Python scripts that are executed on the server.
These are usually `opsi-client-agent`, `opsi-linux-client-agent` and all packages that install Windows operating systems (`win *`).
Details can be found at: <<opsi-4.2-releasenotes-important-reinstall-opsi-packages>>.

After these steps your opsi 4.1 server is migrated to release 4.2 and ready for use.

////
[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-cleanup]]
==== Optionale Aufräumarbeiten

After a migration it can be that some unrequired files still exist on the server.
The reason for this is that they either have been altered manually or that restoring a backup has brought these files back to the system.

The following files resp. folders can be removed:

* TBD
////

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-installation-migration-4.0.7]]
===== Upgrading from opsi 4.0.7
If you are coming from an opsi 4.0.7, you should skip opsi 4.1 and upgrade directly to opsi 4.2.
* First update your server operating system to a version supported by opsi 4.0.7 and 4.2 (e.g. Ubuntu 18.04).
* Then update your opsi server to opsi 4.2 as described above.
* Finally update the opsi-client-agent to the latest stable version 4.2.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-knownbugs]]
== Known bugs / known problems

.KNOWN BUGS:

* opsi-admin: The interactive mode does not work with non-ASCII characters such as ö, ä, ü.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-eol]]
== End of support

Discontinuations are listed in this chapter.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-eol_opsi41]]
=== EOL: opsi 4.1 Q4/2021

So far we have supported the respective opsi version (oldstable) for at least one year parallel to the current version. But in this case we decided to shorten the time to half and to discontinue opsi 4.1 for Q4 2021 (11/30/2021). The main reason for the shortened EOL time: Not all current operating systems support opsi 4.1, including e.g. Ubuntu 20.04.
opsi 4.1 is completely based on Python 2, and this version has already reached EOL in April 2020 and will no longer receive updates.

Via the https://www.uib.de/de/support-schulung/support[opsi support contracts] we are happy to support you to update to the new opsi version. Also after the EOL of opsi 4.1 we are there for you and help with migrations - but we strongly recommend to use the time until the end of Q4/2021 and update to opsi 4.2.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-eol_server]]
=== End of support: Distributions for opsi-server

These distributions will not be supported anymore by opsi for various reasons.

* CentOS 7.x
* Debian 8.x
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.x
* Suse Linux Enterprise Server 12

See the separate chapter: <<opsi-4.2-releasenotes-supportmatrix>>.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-supportmatrix]]
== opsi support matrix

This is an overview on which platforms opsi runs as a server.

include::supportmatrix-server.adoc[]

If you are using opsi-server on an operating system version which is not listed as supported in the previous section, we recommend an operating system upgrade before installing opsi 4.2.


[[opsi-releasenotes-4.2-changes-changed-defaults]]
== Changes in default settings

With opsi 4.2 some default settings have been changed to reflect experiences from running opsi.

This is especially important if new opsi servers are installed in an existing environment, as this may lead to a change in expected behavior.

* Note the changed acl.conf.


[[opsi-releasenotes-4.2-changes-python]]
== Switch to Python 3 and PyInstaller

This version is based on Python 3.
All opsi Python applications (opsiconfd, opsipxeconfd, opsiclientd, opsi-utils, ...) are now distributed as binaries built with PyInstaller.
Please use the `opsi-python` interpreter for your own scripts that need access to the python-opsi library.

[[opsi-releasenotes-4.2-changes-mysql-config]]
== MySQL backend: Limiting connection lifetime

To avoid the error messages: "mysql server has gone away", the default configuration of the MySQL backend was changed. The `connectionPoolRecycling` option now has been set to _28800_ as the default value.
This setting limits the lifetime of the connections in the connection pool, which is used for the connections to MySQL (or MariaDB) server.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-linux]]
== opsi support matrix for Linux clients

This is an overview on which Linux platforms opsi runs as a client.

[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-api-changes]]
== API changes

The API has been changed in opsi 4.2.

Affected by this are among others the API of the web service, opsi-admin and calls made with opsiServiceCall in opsi-script.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-changed-api-methods]]
=== Changed API methods

* `getClients_listOfHashes`: This method was marked as deprecated in opsi 4.1. When called without parameters, this method returns the output of `getClients`. In all other cases an error is returned.
* `getClientIds_list`: This method was marked as deprecated in opsi 4.1. When called without parameters, this method returns the output of `getClientIDs`. If called with parameter `depotIds` then the result of `getClientsOnDepot` will be returned. If called with parameters `productId` and optionally `installationStatus` the result of `getClientsWithProducts` will be returned.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-deprecated-api-methods]]
=== Deprecated API methods

The following methods are considered deprecated. They will be removed with the next major or minor release.

* `getClients_listOfHashes`
* `getClientIds_list`


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-removed-api-methods]]
=== Removal of API methods

The following API methods have been removed:

* `backend_searchIdents`

These methods are no longer available.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-misc]]
== Miscellaneous

* opsiwebservice does not support "deflate" encoded data as a compression method anymore.


[[opsi-4.2-releasenotes-packages]]
== List of packages

.Server packages:
* opsi4ucs 4.2...
* opsiconfd 4.2...
* opsipxeconfd 4.2...
* opsi-server 4.2...
* opsi-utils 4.2...
* opsi-linux-bootimage

NOTE: The updated opsi packages have already been released for opsi 4.1. The only exceptions are `l-opsi-server` and `l-opsi-server-migrate`.
