= Editing the opsi Documentation

This section explains how to edit the https://docs.opsi.org[opsi documentation] directly in our GitLab instance.

TIP: Of course, you can also use Git on the command line or work with a graphical client, download the files of our documentation in AsciiDoc format and work in the text editor of your choice. If you are not yet familiar with AsciiDoc, we recommend taking a look at https://docs.asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor Documentation].
