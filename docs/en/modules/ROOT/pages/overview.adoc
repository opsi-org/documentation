[[opsi-manual-overview]]
= opsi Overview

In complex environments with numerous computers, tools for automatic software distribution and operating system installation become vital. They standardize processes, simplify maintenance in large-scale setups, and consequently, save on costs and time. Unlike many such tools that come with large licensing fees, opsi stands out with its open source license.

NOTE: With opsi, your expenses are tied only to the services you specifically opt for, like consulting, training, and maintenance, or if you choose to use any optional paid modules.

Even though our software and manuals are available free of charge, implementing a software distribution tool is still an investment. To mitigate risks of delays, prolonged training, or extended learning phases, link:https://www.uib.de/[uib GmbH] in Mainz provides a range of comprehensive services around opsi, including training, support, and consultancy.

[[opsi-manual-overview-experience]]
== Origin

Originating in the mid-1990s, opsi was already managing about 2000 Windows computers across different sites for a state administration. Now, the client management system is effectively utilized in numerous small and medium-sized heterogeneous environments. It manages Windows, Linux, and macOS clients, ranging from a dozen to several thousand computers.

[[opsi-manual-overview-structure]]
== Structure

The opsi server stores all data in a database backend (MySQL/MariaDB).

NOTE: Please note that the file-based backend has been discontinued from opsi 4.3 onwards. As of opsi 4.3, only the database backend is supported.

Communication between opsi components and the opsi server is facilitated through a web service. This service, named `opsiconfd`, transfers data to the backend manager, which then commits this data to the backend.
